            "The Met, MoMA and the Guggenheim are just the beginning of a dizzying list of art-world icons. You\u2019ll find museums devoted to everything from fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna to immigrant life in the Lower East Side, and sprawling galleries filled with Japanese sculpture, postmodern American painting, Himalayan textiles and New York City lore. For a glimpse of current and future greats, delve into the cutting-edge galleries of Chelsea and the Lower East Side, with their myriad exhibition spaces and festive opening-night parties (usually Thursday night if you want to join in).",
            "When the sun sinks slowly beyond the Hudson and luminous skyscrapers light up the night, New York transforms into one grand stage. Well-known actors take to the legendary theaters of Broadway as world-class soloists, dancers and musicians perform at venues large and small across town. Whether high culture or low, New York embraces it all: in-your-face rock shows at Williamsburg dives, lavish opera productions at the Lincoln Center, and everything in between. This is a city of experimental theater, improv comedy, indie cinema, ballet, poetry readings, burlesque, world music, jazz and so much more. If you can dream it up, it\u2019s probably happening in NYC.",
            "There\u2019s never been a better time to dine in New York. The city has become a hotbed of seasonal and locally sourced cuisine \u2013 with restaurants growing vegetables on roof gardens or their own upstate farms, sourcing meats and seafood from sustainable outfits nearby, and embracing artisanal everything \u2013 from coffee roasting and whiskey distilling to chocolate- and cheese-making. Bars have also taken creativity to new heights, with pre-Prohibition-era cocktails served alongside delectable small plates \u2013 indeed gastropubs are some of the most creative places to get a meal these days. Of course you can also hit the gourmet food-truck scene or dine more traditionally at one of NYC\u2019s 20,000-plus sit-down restaurants.",

The people, the food, the art: NYC has many virtues, which is why so many of us can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else.",
            "With its compact size and streets packed with eye-candy of all sorts \u2013 architectural treasures, Old World caf\u00e9s, atmospheric booksellers and curio shops \u2013 NYC is an urban wanderer\u2019s delight. Crossing continents is as easy as walking over a few avenues in this jumbled city of 200-plus nationalities. You can lose yourself in the crowds of Chinatown amid brightly painted Buddhist temples, steaming noodle shops and fragrant fishmongers, then stroll up to Nolita for enticing boutiques and coffee-tasting among the craft-minded scenesters. Every neighborhood offers a dramatically different version of New York City \u2013 from the 100-year-old Jewish delis of the Upper West Side to the meandering cobblestone lanes of Greenwich Village. And the best way to experience this city is to walk its streets."

The fog was scented with incense and roast duck. In the basement of City Lights bookstore, near the Muckraking section, I noticed a sign painted by a 1920s cult: 'I am the door.' It's true. San Francisco is the threshold between East and West, body and soul, fact and fiction. That was 20 years ago. I'm still here. You have been warned.",
            "Consider permission permanently granted to be outlandish: other towns may surprise you, but in San Francisco you will surprise yourself. Good times and social revolutions tend to start here, from manic gold rushes to blissful hippie be-ins. If there's a skateboard move yet to be busted, a technology still unimagined, a poem left unspoken or a green scheme untested, chances are it's about to happen here. Yes, right now. This town has lost almost everything in earthquakes and dot-com gambles, but never its nerve.",
            "Every available Bay Area\u2013invented technology is needed to make dinner decisions in this city, with the most restaurants and farmers markets per capita in North America, supplied by pioneering local organic farms. San Francisco set the gold standard for Wild West saloons, but drinking was driven underground in the 1930s with Prohibition. Today San Francisco celebrates its speakeasies and vintage saloons \u2013 and with Wine Country and local distillers providing a steady supply of America's finest hooch, the West remains wild.",
            "Microclimates add magic realism to San Francisco days: when it's drizzling in the outer reaches of Golden Gate Park, it may be sunny in the Mission. A few degrees' difference between neighborhoods grants permission for salted caramel ice cream in Dolores Park, or a hasty retreat to tropical heat inside California Academy of Sciences' rainforest dome. This town will give you goose bumps one minute, and warm you to the core the next.",
            "If California is one grand, sweeping gesture, a long arm cradling the Pacific, then San Francisco, that seven-by-seven-mile peninsula, is a forefinger pointing upwards. Take this as a hint to look up: you'll notice San Francisco's crooked Victorian rooflines, wind-sculpted treetops and fog tumbling over the Golden Gate Bridge.",
            "Heads are perpetually in the clouds atop San Francisco's 43 hills. Cable cars provide easy access to Russian and Nob Hills, and splendid panoramas reward the slog up to Coit Tower \u2013 but the most exhilarating highs are earned on Telegraph Hill's garden-lined stairway walks and windswept hikes around Land's End."

Watching a game is a local rite of passage, whether you slather on the blue-and-orange body paint for a Bears football game, join the raucous baseball crowd in Wrigley Field's bleachers, or plop down on a bar stool at the neighborhood tavern for whatever match is on TV. Count on making lots of spirited new friends. Should the excitement rub off and inspire you to get active yourself, the city's 26 beaches and 580 parks offer a huge array of play options.",
            "Chicago knows how to rock a festival. Between March and September it throws around 200 shindigs. The specialty is music. Blues Fest brings half a million people to Grant Park to hear guitar notes slide and bass lines roll, all for free. During the three-day Lollapalooza mega-party, rock bands thrash while the audience dances in an arm-flailing frenzy. Smaller, barbecue-scented street fests take place in the neighborhoods each weekend \u2013 though some rival downtown for star power on their stages (oh, hey, Olivia Newton-John at Northalsted Market Days).",
            "Loosen your belt \u2013 you've got a lot of eating to do.

High-flying architecture is everywhere, from the stratospheric, glass-floored Willis Tower to Frank Gehry's swooping silver Pritzker Pavilion to Frank Lloyd Wright's stained-glass Robie House. Whimsical public art studs the streets; you might be walking along and wham, there's an abstract Picasso statue that's not only cool to look at, you're allowed to go right up and climb on it. For art museums, take your pick: impressionist masterpieces at the massive Art Institute, psychedelic paintings at the mid-sized Museum of Mexican Art or outsider drawings at the small Intuit gallery.",

For proof, dip into the third-wave coffee shops, the microbreweries with their casual tasting rooms, or the cozy informal bookstores that remain rock solid in a city that spawned Amazon. Then there are the latest national trends that Seattle has helped create: craft cider, pot shops, micro-distilleries, specialist pie-makers, homemade ice cream and fledgling nano-breweries. Walk the streets and scour the neighborhoods; there\u2019s far more to this city than Starbucks' vanilla lattes and Boeing airplanes.",
            "First time in Seattle? Cut to the chase and make a beeline for its proverbial pantry: Pike Place Market. It was founded in 1907 to fortify local inhabitants with fresh Northwest produce, and its long-held mantra of \u2018meet the producer\u2019 still echoes enthusiastically around a city where every restaurateur worth their salt knows the name of their fishmonger and the biography of the cow that made yesterday\u2019s burgers. It doesn\u2019t take long to realize that you\u2019ve arrived in a maelstrom of well-educated palates and wildly experimental chefs who are willing to fuse American cuisine with just about anything \u2013 as long as it\u2019s local.",
            "Visitors setting out to explore Seattle with a blank canvas should think of the city as a United States of Neighborhoods, or \u2013 to put it in more human terms \u2013 a family of affectionate but sometimes errant siblings. There\u2019s the aloof, elegant one (Queen Anne), the cool, edgy one (Capitol Hill), the weird, bearded one (Fremont), the independently minded Scandinavian one (Ballard), the grizzled old grandfather (Pioneer Square) and the precocious adolescent still carving out its identity (South Lake Union). You\u2019ll never fully understand Seattle until you\u2019ve visited them all.",
            "Just because it nurtured tech giants Microsoft and Amazon, it doesn\u2019t mean that Seattle hasn\u2019t got a surreal arty side. Crisscross its urban grid and you\u2019ll find all kinds of freakish apparitions: a rocket sticking out of a shoe shop; a museum built to resemble a smashed-up electric guitar; glass orbs in wooden canoes; a statue of Vladimir Lenin; a mural made of used chewing gum; fish-tossing market traders; and a museum dedicated to antique pinball machines (which you can still play). No, you haven't over-indulged in some powerful (legal) marijuana. You\u2019ve just worked out that Seattle is far more bohemian than beige.",

A move from London (UK) to BC (Canada) in 2004 quickly changed the configuration. Regular sorties south of the 49th parallel taught me that there isn\u2019t just one Seattle, there are at least 10 of them \u2013 mini-cities personified in neighborhoods full of shifting moods and weird subcultures that satisfied pretty much every taste I had."

The students may or may not be here in four years, but my neighbors are here for the long haul. They are the cogs that keep the city running, moving, growing, remembering the past and creating the future.",
            "A word of advice: when in Boston, eat as much seafood as possible. Local specialties include the 'sacred cod,' fresh steamed lobster, oysters on the half-shell and thick, creamy chowder. You can eat seafood around the city, but especially in the fish-centered Seaport District, where it's accompanied by spectacular harbor views. The creatures of the sea are your top priority, but don't miss the chance to devour delectable pasta in the North End and to sample diverse Asian dishes in Chinatown. Trendy fusion restaurants draw on all of these eclectic influences to present contemporary cuisine that is uniquely Boston.",
            "For all intents and purposes, Boston is the oldest city in America. And you can hardly walk a step over its cobblestone streets without running into some historic site. The Freedom Trail winds its way around the city, connecting 16 historically significant sites. These are the very places where history unfolded: from the first public school in America to Boston\u2019s oldest church building to sites linked to America's fight for independence from Britain \u2013 Boston is, in effect, one enormous outdoor history museum.",
            "'Fanatic' is no idle word here. Boston fans are passionate about sports. And with the four-time world-champion Patriots, the long-overdue World Series\u2013winning Red Sox, the winningest basketball team in history, the Celtics, and the highly successful and historic hockey team, the Bruins, there is a lot to be passionate about. Boston's college teams also inspire fierce loyalties and staunch rivalries. No less spirited is the country's oldest and most celebrated running event, the world-famous Boston Marathon, and the world's largest two-day rowing event, the Head of the Charles Regatta.",
            "The arts have thrived in Boston ever since the 19th century, when this cultural capital was dubbed the Athens of America. Certainly, the intellectual elite appreciated their fine paintings and classical music, but they were also dedicated to spreading the cultural wealth, establishing museums, libraries and symphony orchestras for all to enjoy. Today the lucky residents of (and visitors to) Boston benefit from their largesse. These venerable institutions play an integral role on Boston's cultural stage, which has significantly expanded to include dynamic contemporary art, music and theater scenes."

All these varieties of music, plus a few you may never have heard of, are practiced and played here on every corner, in any bar, every night of the week.

And while Boston and Charleston can boast beautiful buildings, New Orleans has a lived-in, cozy feeling that\u2019s easily accessible. As a result of its visible history you'll find a constant, often painful, dialogue with the past, stretching back hundreds of years.

At almost any celebration in town, people engage in masking \u2013 donning a new appearance via some form of costuming \u2013 while acting out the satyric side of human behavior. But the celebrations and rituals of New Orleans are as much about history as hedonism, and every dance is as much an expression of tradition and community spirit as it is of joy."

            "I am endlessly intrigued by B\u011bij\u012bng's ability to reinvent itself. Spending time here is to be on a permanent journey of discovery, where eye-popping buildings appear seemingly overnight, historic h\u00fat\u00f2ng are transformed into hip hang-outs, and new venues open all the time. But some things never change in B\u011bij\u012bng and that is equally enticing. The food is always outstanding and the parks and temples remain oases of peace. Above all, I love being surrounded by the tangible evidence of China's amazing, dramatic history, whether it's the Forbidden City or the Great Wall. It's never boring here.",
            "Food is an obsession for the Chinese and the dazzling array of different dishes you\u2019ll encounter in B\u011bij\u012bng reflects the sheer joy locals take in eating. Dining out is the main social activity; it\u2019s in restaurants that B\u011bij\u012bngers hang out with friends, romance each other, hold family reunions and do business, and the sheer variety of restaurants here is mind-boggling. Menus will have you salivating over succulent Peking duck, delicious dumplings and awesome noodles, but there\u2019s food from every corner of China (and beyond) to be sampled too. From fiery S\u00ecchu\u0101nese to Turkic\u2013inspired Uighur cuisine, B\u011bij\u012bng's 60,000-plus restaurants cover every base.",
            "B\u011bij\u012bng isn\u2019t just the political centre of China \u2013 it\u2019s the cultural heart of the country too. The nation\u2019s top artists, writers, movie-makers and musicians converge here, making this the place to take the pulse of China\u2019s ever-evolving cultural scene. With top-class museums, galleries galore, and an increasing number of music venues, there\u2019s enough to keep you busy day and night. B\u011bij\u012bng is also the centre for the traditional Chinese performing arts. Whether it\u2019s the mystique of Peking opera, tumbling acrobats or the graceful lines of Chinese classical dance that entrances you, the capital has it and more.",
            "Few places on Earth can match the extraordinary historical panorama on display in B\u011bij\u012bng. There are six Unesco World Heritage Sites in this city alone (just one less than the whole of Egypt). At its heart is the magnificent Forbidden City, a royal palace on a scale like no other. B\u011bij\u012bng is also home to sublime temples that aspire to cosmological perfection, while the city centre is criss-crossed by enchanting h\u00fat\u00f2ng: ancient alleyways that teem with life today, as they did hundreds of years ago. And, to cap it all, the awe-inspiring Great Wall snakes its way across the hills north of town.",
            "It's not just the ancient architecture that wows tourists. B\u011bij\u012bng is also home to some of the world's most innovative modern buildings. The world's leading architects clamber for the chance to make their mark on this global powerhouse, and jaw-dropping structures such as the CCTV Building, Galaxy Soho, the NCPA concert hall and the Olympic Stadium are clear signs that B\u011bij\u012bng is not shy about proclaiming its status as China\u2019s capital. Like the temples and palaces of the ancient past, and the imposing socialist realist monuments of the 1950s, these latest additions are built on a scale that screams, \u2018Look at me!\u2019."

            "Tokyo's neon-lit streetscapes still look like a sci-fi film set \u2013 and that's a vision of the city from the 1980s. Tokyo has been building ever since, pushing the boundaries of what's possible on densely populated, earthquake-prone land, adding ever taller, sleeker structures. Come see the utopian mega-malls, the edgy designer boutiques from Japan's award-winning architects, and the world's tallest tower \u2013 Tokyo Sky Tree \u2013 a twisting spire that draws on ancient building techniques. Stand atop one of Tokyo's skyscrapers and look out over the city at night to see it blinking like the control panel of a starship, stretching all the way to the horizon.",

            "I\u2019ve lived in Tokyo for 15 years now and am continuously surprised \u2013 sometimes on a daily basis \u2013 by something new. Such is the joy of living in a city that prides itself on constant renewal and reinvention; it seriously never gets old. Tokyo has everything you can ask of a city, and has it in spades: a rich, cosmopolitan dining scene, more cafes and bars than you could visit in a lifetime, fantastic public transport and grassy parks \u2013 plus it's clean and safe. Really, what's not to love?",
            "Yes, Tokyo has more Michelin stars than any other city. Yes, Japanese cuisine has been added to the Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage list. But that's not what makes dining in Tokyo such an amazing experience. What really counts is the city's long-standing artisan culture. You can splash out on the best sushi of your life, made by one of the city's legendary chefs using the freshest, seasonal market ingredients. You can also spend \u00a5800 on a bowl of noodles made with the same care and exacting attention to detail, from a recipe honed through decades of experience.",
            "Tokyo may be forever reaching into the future but you can still see traces of the shogun's capital on the kabuki stage, at a sumo tournament or under the cherry blossoms. It's a modern city built on old patterns, and in the shadows of skyscrapers you can find anachronistic wooden shanty bars and quiet alleys, raucous traditional festivals and lantern-lit yakitori (grilled chicken) stands. In older neighbourhoods you can shop for handicrafts made just as they have been for centuries, or wander down cobblestone lanes where geisha once trod.",
            "From giant robots to saucer-eyed schoolgirls to a certain, ubiquitous kitty, Japanese pop culture is a phenomenon that has reached far around the world. Tokyo is the country's pop-culture laboratory, where new trends grow legs. Come see the latest looks bubbling out of the backstreets of Harajuku, the hottest pop stars projected on the giant video screens in Shibuya, or the newest anime and manga flying off the shelves in Akihabara. Gawk at the giant statues of Godzilla; shop for your favourite character goods; or pick up some style inspiration just walking down the street."

Yes, it's an ancient Japanese woodblock print come to life with its geisha and impossibly pretty cherry-blossom trees, but it's also a university town with a youthful feel and modernity breathing down its traditional neck.",
            "There are said to be over 1000 Buddhist temples in Kyoto. You\u2019ll find true masterpieces of religious architecture, such as the retina-burning splendour of Kinkaku-ji (the famed Golden Pavilion) and the cavernous expanse of Higashi Hongan-ji. Within the temple precincts are some of the world\u2019s most sublime gardens, from the Zen masterpiece at Ry\u014dan-ji to the riotous paradise of moss and blossoms at Saih\u014d-ji. And then there are the Shint\u014d shrines, monuments to Japan\u2019s indigenous faith. The mother of all shrines, Fushimi Inari-Taisha, has mesmerising arcades of vermilion torii (entrance gate to a Shint\u014d shrine) spread across a mountainside.",
            "Few cities of this size offer such a range of excellent restaurants. Work your way through the entire spectrum of Japanese food, from impossibly refined cuisine known as kaiseki to hearty plebeian fare like ramen. There\u2019s also a wide range of French, Italian and Chinese restaurants, where the famed Japanese attention to detail is paired with local ingredients to yield fantastic results. Best of all, many of Kyoto\u2019s restaurants are in traditional wooden buildings, where you can gaze over intimate private gardens while you eat.",
            "While the rest of Japan has adopted modernity with abandon, the old ways are still clinging on in Kyoto. Visit an old sh\u014dtengai (market street) and admire the ancient speciality shops: tofu sellers, washi (Japanese handmade paper) stores and tea merchants. Then wander through the old streets of Nishijin and Gion past machiya (traditional Japanese townhouses). That's not to say there's nothing modern about Kyoto \u2013 arriving into futuristic Kyoto Station is a stark sign of that. And throughout the city, young Kyotoites don the hottest new fashions, while craft beer and single-origin coffee is taking over.",
            "No educated Kyotoite would dare send a letter without making a reference to the season. The city\u2019s geisha change their hair ornaments 12 times a year to celebrate the natural world. And Kyoto\u2019s confectioners create seasonal sweets that reflect whatever is in bloom. Starting in February and lasting through the summer, a series of blossoms burst open like a string of firecrackers: plums, daphnes, cherries, camellias, azaleas and wisteria, among many others. And don\u2019t forget the shinryoku (the new green of April) and the brilliant autumn foliage of November."

            "Paris\u2019 dining is iconic: France\u2019s reputation for its cuisine (the French word for \u2018kitchen\u2019) precedes it, and whether you seek a cosy neighbourhood bistro or a triple-Michelin-starred temple to gastronomy, you'll find every establishment prides itself on exquisite preparation and presentation of quality produce, invariably served with wine. Enticing patisseries, boulangeries (bakeries), fromageries (cheese shops) and crowded, colourful street markets are perfect for packing a picnic to take to the city\u2019s parks and gardens. A host of culinary courses \u2013 from home kitchens through to the world\u2019s most prestigious cookery schools \u2013 offers instruction for all schedules, abilities and budgets.",
            "The wrought-iron spire of the Eiffel Tower piercing the clouds, the broad Arc de Triomphe guarding Paris\u2019 most glamorous avenue, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the gargoyled Notre Dame cathedral, lamplit bridges spanning the Seine and art nouveau cafes spilling on to wicker-chair-lined terraces are indelibly etched in the minds of anyone who\u2019s visited the city \u2013 and the imaginations of anyone who hasn\u2019t (yet). But despite initial appearances, Paris\u2019 cityscape isn\u2019t static: there are some stunning modern and contemporary icons too, from the inside-out, industrial-style Centre Pompidou to the mur v\u00e9g\u00e9tal (vertical garden) gracing the striking Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly.",

Paris remains at the forefront of international trends, and browsing emerging and established designer boutiques and flagship haute couture houses is a quintessential part of any visit. You\u2019ll also find uberhip concept stores, quirky homeware shops, and resplendent art nouveau department stores, along with a trove of vintage shops and flea markets, atmospheric bookshops (including the dark-green bouquiniste stalls \u2013 secondhand bookshop \u2013 lining the riverbanks), adorable children\u2019s wear and toy shops, art and antique dealers, venerable shops selling state-of-the-art professional cookware, and, of course, gourmet food and wine shops galore.",

In addition to big hitters like the incomparable Louvre, the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay\u2019s exceptional impressionist collection, and the Centre Pompidou\u2019s cache of modern and contemporary art, there are scores of smaller museums housing collections in every imaginable genre, and a diverse range of venues mounting major exhibitions through to off-beat installations.",

            "Rio's beaches have long seduced visitors. Copacabana Beach became a symbol of Rio during the 1940s, when international starlets would jet in for the weekend. Hogging the spotlight these days is Ipanema Beach, its fame and beauty unabated since bossa nova stars Tom Jobim and Vin\u00edcius de Moraes introduced the world to its allure in the 1960s. For cariocas (residents of Rio), the beach is Rio's backyard \u2013 a playground that's free and open to all, offering endless enjoyment in the form of football, volleyball, surfing, snacking, drinking or simply relaxing amid the passing parade of people.",
            "Looking out from the 710m peak of Corcovado, you will see why Rio is called the Cidade Maravilhosa (Marvelous City). Lushly forested mountains fringe the city, shimmering beaches trace the shoreline and a string of tiny islands lie scattered along the seafront. Far from being mere cinematic backdrop, this seaside beauty hosts outstanding outdoor adventures: hiking in the Tijuca rainforest, cycling alongside the lake and beaches, sailing across Ba\u00eda de Guanabara, and surfing, rock climbing and hang gliding amid one of the world's most stunning urban landscapes.",
            "Music is the lifeblood of Rio, with a soundtrack comprising rock, old-school bossa nova, hip-hop, funk and Brazil's many regional styles. Above all there's samba, a rapid-fire style of music with African influences and an infectious beat that is synonymous with Rio. You can hear it all over town, but the soul of samba resides in Lapa, an edgy red-light district that is home to dozens of live-music halls and an enormous weekend street party that draws revelers from all walks of life. Samba is also the integral sound during Carnaval, and the danceable backing music to street parties and all-night parades.",
            "Speaking of Carnaval, Rio knows how to party. Whether you call it joie de vivre, Lebensfreude or lust for life, cariocas have it in spades. Carnaval, and the buildup to it, is the most obvious manifestation of this celebratory spirit. But Rio has many other occasions for revelry: celebrations after a big Flamengo (or Vasco, Fluminense or Botafogo) soccer match; weekend samba parties around town; baile funk parties in the favelas (slums, informal communities); and boat parties on the bay \u2013 not to mention major fests such as R\u00e9veillon (New Year's Eve) and the Festas Juninas.",

And although the main event doesn\u2019t start until late February, the samba schools\u2019 weekly ensaios (rehearsal events) are in full swing by the start of December. Ever the outdoors city, the rising temperatures draw locals and tourists alike to Rio\u2019s beaches and forest waterfalls, and the longer days give visitors even more time to gaze in awe at the city\u2019s abundance of breath-taking views. On clear, sunny days, the iconic landmarks \u2013 Corcovado, Sugarloaf Mountain and Ipanema beach \u2013 will not disappoint. However, Rio has plenty more to offer those willing to dig a little deeper. The city\u2019s rich culture of music and food is best explored in the bars and samba clubs in the bohemian neighborhoods of Lapa and Santa Teresa. And although you are never far from the manic noise of a party, some of Rio\u2019s most charming pleasures are the simplest: enjoying an ice cold beer on the Mureta da Urca, a tranquil stroll through the Botanical Gardens or taking in the sunset from the rocks of Arpoador."

            "Few cities can rival Rome's astonishing artistic heritage. Throughout history, the city has starred in the great upheavals of Western art, drawing the top artists of the day and inspiring them to push the boundaries of creative achievement. The result is a city awash with priceless treasures. Ancient statues adorn world-class museums, Byzantine mosaics and Renaissance frescoes dazzle in the city's art-rich churches, baroque facades flank medieval piazzas. Walk around the centre and without even trying you\u2019ll come across masterpieces by the giants of the artistic pantheon \u2013 sculptures by Michelangelo, canvases by Caravaggio, Raphael frescoes and fountains by Bernini.",
            "A trip to Rome is as much about lapping up the dolce vita lifestyle as gorging on art and culture. It's about relaxing into the city's Mediterranean rhythms and idling around the picturesque streets. Whiling away hours at streetside cafes and people-watching on pretty piazzas are an integral part of the Roman experience. The tempo rises as the heat of the day fades into the evening cool and the fashionably dressed aperitivo (aperitif) crowd descends on the city's bars and cafes. Restaurants and trattorias hum with activity and cheerful hordes mill around popular haunts before heading off to cocktail bars and late-night clubs.",
            "Eating out is one of Rome's great pleasures and the combination of romantic al fresco settings and superlative food is a guarantee of good times. For contemporary fine dining and five-star wine there are any number of refined restaurants, but for a truly Roman meal search out the city's boisterous pizzerias and convivial neighbourhood trattorias. These are where the locals go to dine with friends and indulge their passion for thin, crispy pizzas, humble but delicious pastas, and cool white wine from the nearby Castelli Romani hills. ",
            "The result of 3000 years of ad hoc urban development, Rome's cityscape is an exhilarating spectacle. Ancient icons such as the Colosseum, Roman Forum and Pantheon recall Rome's time as the fearsome hub of the Roman Empire, the caput mundi (capital of the world), while catacombs and clandestine churches hark back to the early days of Christianity. Lording it over the Vatican, St Peter's Basilica is the greatest of the city's monumental basilicas, a towering masterpiece of Renaissance architecture. Elsewhere, ornate piazzas and elaborate churches add a baroque flourish to the city's historic streets.",

            "Garden islands and lagoon aquaculture yield speciality produce and seafood you won\u2019t find elsewhere \u2013 all highlighted in inventive Venetian cuisine, with tantalising traces of ancient spice routes. The city knows how to put on a royal spread, as France\u2019s King Henry III once found out when faced with 1200 dishes and 200 bonbons. Today such feasts are available in miniature at happy hour, when bars mount lavish spreads of cicheti (Venetian tapas). Save room and time for a proper sit-down Venetian meal, with lagoon seafood to match views at canalside bistros and toasts with Veneto\u2019s signature bubbly, prosecco.",
            "Never was a thoroughfare so aptly named as the Grand Canal, reflecting the glories of Venetian architecture lining its banks. At the end of Venice\u2019s signature waterway, Palazzo Ducale and Basilica di San Marco add double exclamation points. But wait until you see what\u2019s hiding in narrow backstreets: neighbourhood churches lined with Veroneses and priceless marbles, Tiepolo\u2019s glimpses of heaven on homeless-shelter ceilings, and a tiny Titian that mysteriously lights up an entire cathedral.",
            "The city built on water was never afraid to attempt the impossible. When plague struck, Venice consulted its brain trust of Mediterranean doctors, who recommended a precaution that has saved untold lives since: quarantine. Under attack by Genovese rivals, Venice\u2019s Arsenale shipyards innovated the assembly line, producing a new warship every day to defeat Genoa. After Genoa backed Christopher Columbus' venture to the New World, Venice's shipping fortunes began to fade \u2013 but Venice wasn't about to relinquish the world stage, going on to become the launching pad for baroque music and modern opera.",
            "Eyeglasses, platform shoes and uncorseted dresses are outlandish Venetian fashions that continental critics sniffed would never be worn by respectable Europeans. When prolific Ghetto publishing houses circulated Renaissance ideas, Rome banned Venice from publishing books. The city was excommunicated for ignoring such bans \u2013 but when savvy Venice withheld tithes, Rome recanted. Venice\u2019s artistic triumphs over censorship now grace the magnificent Gallerie dell\u2019Accademia.",

It makes marble palaces vanish into silent fogs, labyrinthine calli (streets) disappear at the whim of moody tides, and can even turn the most pedestrian of people into fantastical, masked creatures. Just like its world-famous Carnevale, Venice thrives on mystery and awe, from the secret passageways that riddle Gothic Palazzo Ducale, to the esoteric powers of the Basilica di Santa Maria della Salute, to the inexplicable radiance of Titian's Assunta altarpiece. After countless sojourns, I am yet to tire of the place. Some spells are simply too hard to break."

A-lister fashion houses lace Via de' Tornabuoni and a Pandora's box of specialist boutiques selling all manner of beautiful objects parade alongside family-run botteghe (workshops) in a glorious tangle of medieval backstreets.

Not only is Milan a treasure trove of 20th-century art, but art deco and rationalist architecture abound. Today the city leads the way with the largest post-war re-development in Italy, impressive, sustainable architecture and a futuristic skyline modelled by Zaha Hadid, Daniel Libeskind and C\u00e9sar Pelli. And there\u2019s more to come with ambitious plans to mould the city into a hi-tech hub, home to the likes of Google, Microsoft, Alibaba and Apple.",

Mercantile Milan invented the idea of the city-state and the Edict of Milan (AD 313) ended the persecution of Christians. Art collections old and new mark the genius of Old Masters and provoke new conversations about where the world is headed. Prestigious nights at La Scala and an illustrious literary heritage are balanced by a diverse contemporary music and publishing scene.

In addition, Milan is home to all the major design showrooms and an endless round of trade fairs. And it\u2019s not just insiders who have all the fun.

Hikers can wind along precipitous coastlines, climb erupting volcanoes and traipse through flowery mountain meadows; birders benefit from the plethora of species on the Africa-Europe migration route; and divers and swimmers enjoy some of the Mediterranean's most pristine waters.

            "More than a decade after I fell for Madrid and decided to call it home, the life that courses relentlessly through the streets here still excites me. Here is a place where the passions of Europe\u2019s most passionate country are the fabric of daily life, a city with music in its soul and an unshakeable spring in its step. But Madrid is also one of the most open cities on earth and it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from for the oft-heard phrase to ring true: \u2018If you\u2019re in Madrid, you\u2019re from Madrid\u2019.",
            "Madrid may lack the cachet of Paris, the monumental history of Rome, or Barcelona\u2019s reputation for Modernista masterpieces. And no, there is no equivalent of the Eiffel Tower, Colosseum or La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia that you can point to and say \u2018this is Madrid\u2019. But Madrid has nothing to be envious of. Spain's broad sweep of architectural history provides a glorious backdrop to city life, from medieval mansions and royal palaces to the unimagined angles of Spanish contemporary architecture, from the sober brickwork and slate spires of Madrid baroque to the extravagant confections of the belle \u00e9poque. Put simply, this is one beautiful city.",
            "Few cities boast an artistic pedigree quite as pure as Madrid\u2019s: many art lovers return here again and again. For centuries, Spanish royals showered praise and riches upon the finest artists of the day, from home-grown talents such as Goya and Vel\u00e1zquez to Flemish and Italian greats. Masterpieces by these and other Spanish painters such as Picasso, Dal\u00ed and Mir\u00f3 now adorn the walls of the city\u2019s world-class galleries. Three in particular are giants \u2013 the Museo del Prado, Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda and Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza \u2013 but in Madrid these are merely good places to start.",
            "Rising above the humble claims of its local cuisine, Madrid has evolved into one of the richest culinary capitals of Europe. The city has wholeheartedly embraced all the creativity and innovation of Spain\u2019s gastronomic revolution. But this acceptance of the new is wedded to a passion for the enduring traditions of Spanish cooking, for the conviviality of the eating experience and for showcasing the infinite variety of food from every Spanish region. From tapas in sleek temples to all that\u2019s new to sit-down meals beneath centuries-old vaulted ceilings, eating in Madrid is a genuine pleasure.",
            "Madrid nights are the stuff of legend, and the perfect complement to the more sedate charms of fine arts and fine dining. The city may have more bars than any other city on earth \u2013 a collection of storied cocktail bars and nightclubs that combine a hint of glamour with non-stop marcha (action). But that only goes some way to explaining the appeal of after-dark Madrid. Step out into the night-time streets of many Madrid neighbourhoods and you\u2019ll find yourself swept along on a tide of people, accompanied by a happy crowd intent on dancing until dawn."
