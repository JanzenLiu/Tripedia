        "One of the world\u2019s most renowned green spaces, Central Park spreads across 843 acres of rolling meadows, boulder-studded outcroppings, elm-lined walkways, manicured European-style gardens, a lake and a reservoir \u2014 not to mention an outdoor theater, a memorial to John Lennon, an idyllic waterside eatery (the Loeb Boathouse) and one very famous statue of Alice in Wonderland. Highlights include Sheep Meadow, where thousands of people lounge and play on warm days; Central Park Zoo; and the forest-like paths of the Ramble.",
        "Like the city\u2019s subway system, the vast and majestic Central Park, a rectangle of open space in the middle of Manhattan, is a great class leveler \u2013 exactly what it was envisioned to be. Created in the 1860s and \u201970s by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux on the marshy northern fringe of the city, the immense park was designed as a leisure space for all New Yorkers, regardless of color, class or creed. It\u2019s also an oasis from the insanity: the lush lawns, cool forests, flowering gardens, glassy bodies of water and meandering, wooded paths providing the dose of serene nature that New Yorkers crave.",
        "Olmsted and Vaux (who also created Prospect Park in Brooklyn) were determined to keep foot and road traffic separate and cleverly designed the cross-town transverses under elevated roads to do so. That such a large expanse of prime real estate has survived intact for so long again proves that nothing eclipses the heart, soul and pride that forms the foundation of New York City\u2019s greatness.",
        "Today, this \u2018people\u2019s park\u2019 is still one of the city\u2019s most popular attractions, beckoning throngs of New Yorkers with free outdoor concerts on the Great Lawn, precious animals at the Central Park Wildlife Center and top-notch drama at the annual Shakespeare in the Park productions, held each summer at the open-air Delacorte Theater. Other recommended stops include the ornate Bethesda Fountain, which edges the Lake and its Loeb Boathouse, where you can rent rowboats or enjoy lunch at an outdoor cafe; the Shakespeare Garden, on the west side between 79th and 80th Sts, with its lush plantings and excellent skyline views; and the Ramble, a wooded thicket that\u2019s popular with bird-watchers. While parts of the park swarm with joggers, in-line skaters, musicians and tourists on warm weekends, it\u2019s quieter on weekday afternoons, especially in less well-trodden spots above 72nd St, such as the Harlem Meer and the North Meadow (north of 97th St).",
        "Folks flock to the park even in winter, when snowstorms inspire cross-country skiing and sledding or just a simple stroll through the white wonderland, and crowds turn out every New Year\u2019s Eve for a midnight run. The Central Park Conservancy offers ever-changing guided tours of the park, including ones that focus on public art, wildlife and places of interest to kids."

Its permanent collection has more than two million individual objects, from Egyptian temples to American paintings. Known colloquially as \u2018The Met,\u2019 the museum attracts over six million visitors a year to its 17 acres of galleries \u2013 making it the largest single-site attraction in New York City. In other words, plan on spending some time here \u2013 it is B-I-G.",
        "The museum has an unrivaled collection of ancient Egyptian art, some of which dates back to the Paleolithic era. Located to the north of the Great Hall, the 39 Egyptian galleries open dramatically with one of the Met\u2019s prized pieces: the Mastaba Tomb of Perneb (c 2300 BC), an Old Kingdom burial chamber crafted from limestone. Also not to be missed is the Temple of Dendur, built around 10 BC south of Aswan, Egypt, and relocated to the Met in 1978.",
        "On the museum\u2019s 2nd floor, the European Paintings galleries display a stunning collection of masterworks. The \u2018New Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Later South Asia\u2019 are comprised of 15 incredible rooms that showcase the museum\u2019s extensive collection of art from the Middle East and Central and South Asia.",
        "In the northwest corner, the American galleries showcase a wide variety of decorative and fine art from throughout US history. The 27 galleries devoted to classical antiquity are another Met doozy, some of which are dramatically illuminated by natural daylight.",
        "The most popular galleries with children are generally the Egyptian, African and Oceania galleries (great masks) and the collection of medieval arms and armor \u2013 all of which are on the 1st floor.

It\u2019s also home to the Roof Garden Caf\u00e9 & Martini Bar, the best place in the museum for a sip \u2014 especially at sunset. The roof garden is open from April to October.",

In addition to being a controversial urban planning move, Lincoln Center wasn\u2019t exactly well-received on an architectural level \u2013 it was relentlessly criticized for its conservative design, fortress-like aspect and poor acoustics. For the center\u2019s 50th anniversary (2009\u201310), Diller Scofidio + Renfro and other architects gave the complex a much-needed and critically-acclaimed freshening up.",
        "A survey of the three classic buildings surrounding the central Revson Fountain is a must: the Metropolitan Opera, David Geffen Hall (called Avery Fisher Hall until 2015) and the David H Koch Theater, the latter designed by Philip Johnson. (These are all located on the main plaza at Columbus Ave, between 62nd and 65th Sts.) The fountain is spectacular in the evenings when it puts on Las Vegas\u2013like light shows.",

        "Completed in 1913, Grand Central Terminal \u2013 more commonly, if technically incorrectly, called Grand Central Station \u2013 is one of New York\u2019s beaux-arts beauties. Adorned with Tennessee-marble floors and Italian-marble ticket counters, its glorious main concourse is capped by a vaulted ceiling depicting the constellations, designed by French painter Paul C\u00e9sar Helleu. When commuters complained that the sky is backwards \u2013 painted as if looking down from above, not up \u2013 it was asserted as intentional (possibly to avoid having to admit an error).",
        "The original, frescoed execution of Helleu's design was by New York\u2013based artists J Monroe Hewlett and Charles Basing. Moisture damage saw it faithfully repainted (alas, not in fresco form) by Charles Gulbrandsen in 1944. By the 1990s, however, the mural was in ruins again. Enter renovation architects Beyer Blinder Belle, who restored the work, but left a tiny patch of soot (in the northwest corner) that stands testament to just what a fine job they did.",
        "Clad in Connecticut Stony Creek granite at its base and Indiana limestone on top, Grand Central's showpiece facade is crowned by America's greatest monumental sculpture, The Glory of Commerce. Designed by the French sculptor Jules F\u00e9lix Coutan, the piece was executed in Long Island City by local carvers Donnelly and Ricci. Once completed, it was hoisted up, piece by piece, in 1914. Its protagonist is a wing-capped Mercury, the Roman god of travel and commerce. To the left is Hercules in an unusually placid stance, while looking down on the mayhem of 42nd St is Minerva, the ancient guardian of cities. The clock beneath Mercury's foot contains the largest example of Tiffany glass in the world.",
        "These days, Grand Central\u2019s underground electric tracks serve only commuter trains en route to northern suburbs and Connecticut. But whether you\u2019re traveling somewhere or not, the station merits a special trip for the architecture alone \u2013 not to mention for its vaulted Grand Central Oyster Bar & Restaurant, and grab-and-go Grand Central Market."

The second, Peak Immigration Years, explores the motives behind the immigrants' journeys and the challenges they faced in beginning their new American lives.",

        "Designed by William Van Alen in 1930, the 77-floor Chrysler Building is prime-time architecture: a fusion of Moderne and Gothic aesthetics, adorned with steel eagles and topped by a spire that screams Bride of Frankenstein. The building was constructed as the headquarters for Walter P Chrysler and his automobile empire; unable to compete on the production line with bigger rivals Ford and General Motors, Chrysler trumped them on the skyline, and with one of Gotham's most beautiful lobbies.",
        "Indeed, while the Chrysler Building might not offer a restaurant or observation deck, its lobby makes for a lavish consolation prize. Here, dark African wood and marble contrast against the brash, man-made steel of industrial America. The lobby's elaborately veneered elevators are especially beautiful, their Egyptian lotus motifs made of inlaid Japanese ash, Oriental walnut and Cuban plum-pudding wood. Above is painter Edward Trumbull's ceiling mural Transport and Human Endeavor. Purportedly the world\u2019s largest mural at 97ft by 100ft, its depiction of buildings, airplanes and industrious workers on Chrysler assembly lines shows the golden promise of industry and modernity.",
        "Topping out at 1046 ft with its spire, it held the title of the world's tallest building for 11 months until the nearby Empire State Building was built. More than 80 years on, Chrysler's ambitious $15 million statement remains one of New York's most poignant symbols. For a great view of the Chrysler Building, head to the corner of Third Ave and 44th St, from where you can appreciate the building's slimline profile, gargoyles and spire in one hit. If you have binoculars, bring them for a close-up view of the facade's detailing, which includes basket-weave motifs and a band of abstract automobiles. Alternatively, head to the top of the Empire State Building, where pay-per-view telescopes from the observation deck will get you up close and personal with that gleaming steel spire."

        "A New York icon, the Brooklyn Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and Manhattan, was the world\u2019s first steel suspension bridge. Indeed, when it opened in 1883, the 1596ft span between its two support towers was the longest in history. Although its construction was fraught with disaster, the bridge became a magnificent example of urban design, inspiring poets, writers and painters. Its pedestrian walkway delivers soul-stirring views of lower Manhattan, the East River and the rapidly developing Brooklyn waterfront.",
        "Ironically, one man deprived of this view was the bridge's own designer, John Roebling. The Prussian-born engineer was knocked off a pier in Fulton Landing in June 1869, dying of tetanus poisoning before construction of the Brooklyn Bridge even began. Consequently, his son, Washington Roebling, supervised its construction, which lasted 14 years and managed to survive budget overruns and the deaths of 20 workers. The younger Roebling himself suffered from the bends (decompression sickness) while helping to excavate the riverbed for the bridge\u2019s western tower and remained bedridden for much of the project; his wife Emily oversaw construction in his stead. There was one final tragedy to come in June 1883, when the bridge opened to pedestrian traffic. Someone in the crowd shouted (perhaps meaning it as a joke) that the bridge was collapsing into the river, setting off a mad rush in which 12 people were trampled to death.",
        "Structural repairs on the bridge that began in 2010 are supposed to last until 2022, a headache for local residents and drivers alike. Still, beautiful as ever, it can be a challenging crossing. Take care to stay on the side of the walkway marked for folks on foot, and not in the bike lane."

Isamu Noguchi's News sits above the entrance to the Associated Press Building (50 Rockefeller Plaza), while Jos\u00e9 Maria Sert's oil American Progress awaits in the lobby of the GE Building. The latter work replaced Mexican artist Diego Rivera's original painting, rejected by the Rockefellers for containing \u2018communist imagery.\u2019",
        "Come the festive season, Rockefeller Plaza is where you'll find New York's most famous Christmas tree. Ceremoniously lit just after Thanksgiving, it's a tradition that dates back to the 1930s, when construction workers set up a small tree on the site.

The famous antenna was originally meant to be a mooring mast for zeppelins, but the Hindenberg disaster slammed the brakes on that plan.

        "Alcatraz: for over 150 years, the name has given the innocent chills and the guilty cold sweats. Over the decades, it\u2019s been the nation\u2019s first military prison, a forbidding maximum-security penitentiary and disputed territory between Native American activists and the FBI. No wonder that first step you take onto \u2018the Rock\u2019 seems to cue ominous music: dunh-dunh-dunnnnh!",
        "It all started innocently enough back in 1775, when Spanish lieutenant Juan Manuel de Ayala sailed the San Carlos past the 22-acre island he called Isla de Alcatraces (Isle of the Pelicans). In 1859 a new post on Alcatraz became the first US West Coast fort, and soon proved handy as a holding pen for Civil War deserters, insubordinates and those who had been court-martialed. Among the prisoners were Native American scouts and \u2018unfriendlies,\u2019 including 19 Hopis who refused to send their children to government boarding schools where speaking Hopi and practicing their religion were punishable by beatings. By 1902 the four cell blocks of wooden cages were rotting, unsanitary and otherwise ill-equipped for the influx of US soldiers convicted of war crimes in the Philippines. The army began building a new concrete military prison in 1909, but upkeep was expensive and the US soon had other things to worry about: WWI, financial ruin and flappers.",
        "When the 18th Amendment to the Constitution declared selling liquor a crime in 1922, rebellious Jazz Agers weren\u2019t prepared to give up their tipple \u2013 and gangsters kept the booze coming. Authorities were determined to make a public example of criminal ringleaders, and in 1934 the Federal Bureau of Prisons took over Alcatraz as a prominent showcase for its crime-fighting efforts. \u2018The Rock\u2019 averaged only 264 inmates, but its roster read like an America\u2019s Most Wanted list. A-list criminals doing time on Alcatraz included Chicago crime boss Al \u2018Scarface\u2019 Capone, dapper kidnapper George \u2018Machine Gun\u2019 Kelly, hot-headed Harlem mafioso and sometime poet \u2018Bumpy\u2019 Johnson, and Morton Sobell, the military contractor found guilty of Soviet espionage along with Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.",
        "Today, first-person accounts of daily life in the Alcatraz lockup are included on the award-winning audio tour provided by Alcatraz Cruises. But take your headphones off for just a moment, and notice the sound of carefree city life traveling across the water: this is the torment that made perilous escapes into rip tides worth the risk. Though Alcatraz was considered escape-proof, in 1962 the Anglin brothers and Frank Morris floated away on a makeshift raft and were never seen again. Security and upkeep proved prohibitively expensive, and finally the island prison was abandoned to the birds in 1963.",
        "Native Americans claimed sovereignty over the island in the \u201960s, noting that Alcatraz had long been used by the Ohlone as a spiritual retreat, yet federal authorities refused their proposal to turn Alcatraz into a Native American study center. Then on the eve of Thanksgiving 1969, 79 Native American activists swam to the island and took it over. During the next 19 months, some 5600 Native Americans would visit the occupied island. Public support eventually pressured President Richard Nixon to restore Native territory and strengthen self-rule for Native nations in 1970. Each Thanksgiving Day since 1975, an \u2018Un-Thanksgiving\u2019 ceremony has been held at dawn on Alcatraz, with Native leaders and supporters showing their determination to reverse the course of colonial history. After the government regained control of the island, it became a national park, and by 1973 had already become a major draw. Today the cell blocks, \u2018This Is Indian Land\u2019 water-tower graffiti and rare wildlife are all part of the attraction."

        "There are dive areas all around Goat Island, which sits just offshore, or you can snorkel or dive directly from the beach. Colourful sponges, forests of seaweed, boarfish, crayfish and stingrays are common sights, and if you\u2019re very lucky you may see orcas and bottle-nosed dolphins. Visibility is claimed to be at least 10m, 75% of the time."

The museum's current star attraction is the state-of-the-art exhibition 'Gallipoli: The Scale of Our War', charting the country's involvement in WWI's Gallipoli campaign through the experiences of eight ordinary New Zealanders; key to the exhibition's impact are the hyper-real models produced by Weta Workshop, which bring it all to life.

A ride on the tram is a classic Hong Kong experience, with vertiginous views over the city as you ascend up the steep mountainside.",

        "This 400-year-old village inside Plover Cove Country Park is arguably Hong Kong's best-preserved Hakka walled village and has an intact feng shui woodland. Featuring 200 houses, three ancestral halls, two temples, and a breezy square fringed by banyans and opening onto recently revived rice paddies, Lai Chi Wo is not only a sight to behold, but also one of Hong Kong's most biologically diverse freshwater wetlands.",
        "Along a stream leading to the village is the looking-glass mangrove with buttress roots forming a lace-like pattern. Also here is the white-flower Derris, a climbing vine with long, supple branches like elongated arms that form a natural swing. The Derris plant is poisonous and can be used as a fish stunner or insecticide, but only the root is harmful and only when crushed \u2013 there are butterflies and dragonflies aplenty here, hovering over scuttling mangrove crabs.",
        "A 5- to 7-hectare crescent-shaped wood embraces the village from behind \u2013 this is ideal for the feng shui of a Hakka village. Not only does having the backing of wood bring good luck, it fosters a good life. Thickly grown trees and shrubs serve as a natural barrier against enemies and the elements, and are a source of food, fuel and construction materials. Lai Chi Wo was once the most affluent Hakka walled village in the northeastern New Territories.",
        "Though almost completely abandoned in the 1960s, Lai Chi Wo has been undergoing a revival thanks to the efforts of villagers, academics and conservationists. The growing of rice and vegetables has resumed on a cautious scale, pig and cow sheds have been restored, and shuttered village houses now function as education and research facilities.",
        "The village runs 90-minute guided tours every Sunday and public holiday \u2013 the ecological tour at 11am, and the cultural tour at 11am and 1.30pm. There's also a fabulous Hakka sticky-rice dumpling making workshop from 1.30pm to 3pm. Register at the village square or inform them before you go to ensure a place.",
        "Bespoke tours can be arranged on weekdays, but make contact at least two weeks in advance. Currently the 9am Sunday ferry from the Ma Liu Shui Pier is the only direct public transport to the village, but sailings are expected to increase in the near future. The return sailing is at 3.30pm. Lai Chi Wo is only a 10-minute boat ride from the frontier town of Sha Tau Kok, but you'll need the Lai Chi Wo volunteers to get you a permit as the pier is in a closed area.",
        "Most Hong Kong Global Geopark Sedimentary Rock tours make a stop at Lai Chi Wo, or just hike there from Wu Kau Tang or Luk Keng, and lunch at Yau Kee.",
        "All tour, workshop and sailing times given were valid at the time of research, but may be subject to change in the coming months.",
        "A ferry departs for Lai Chi Wo every Sunday at 9am from the Ma Liu Shui Pier near the Chinese University and returns at 3.30pm. Service will be expanded to at least two sailings a week in the near future.",
        "Green minibus 20C, operating between Tai Po Market MTR station and Tai Mei Tuk, goes beyond Tai Mei Tuk to Wu Kau Tang once every one to two hours between 5.45am to 7.45pm daily, with the last minibus returning from Wu Kau Tang at around 8.15pm. From Wu Kau Tang, it's a 90-minute walk to Lai Chi Wo.",
        "On Sundays and public holidays, bus route 275R goes from Tai Po Market MTR station to Bride\u2019s Pool, which is only a 15-minute walk from Wu Kau Tang.",
        "Green minibus 56K leaves Fanling MTR station for Luk Keng at 30-minute intervals on weekdays, and 10-minute intervals on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. From Luk Keng, it's a two-hour walk to Lai Chi Wo."

He is also a favourite god of businesspeople.

        "Spread over five levels, life-size creatures are the focal point throughout, with taxidermied (mostly realistic) animals, birds and reptiles, and models of soaring marine animals hanging spectacularly from the top floor. The African Savannah exhibit on the basement floor is a highlight, capturing all the drama of life on the plains with an epic full-wall animation feature screening on the hour.",
        "Dinosaur fossils are well represented (including the indigenous Yunnanese 'Lufeng lizard'); these are interspersed with impressive life-like mechanical dinosaurs that move and roar.",
        "The building's exterior spirals like a nautilus shell topped by a curved lawn embankment, Chinese-inspired water garden and vertical garden wall. Within, the main architectural feature is a 30m-high glass atrium, with a conical molecular-shaped glass 'cell wall' that floods the building with natural light. Symbolic of the living organisms within, its transparent core holds a tranquil courtyard garden with a pond full of plants, trickling waterfalls and rocky outcrops."

An upscale entertainment and shopping complex modelled on traditional alleyway (l\u00f2ngt\u00e1ng) homes, this was the first development in the city to prove that historical architecture makes big commercial sense. Elsewhere that might sound like a no-brainer, but in 21st-century China, where bulldozers are always on standby, it came as quite a revelation.",
        "Well-heeled shoppers and alfresco diners keep things lively until late, and if you\u2019re looking for a memorable meal or to browse through some of Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei\u2019s more fashionable boutiques, you\u2019re in the right spot. The heart of the complex, divided into a pedestrianised north and south block, consists of largely rebuilt traditional sh\u00edk\u00f9m\u00e9n houses, brought bang up-to-date with a stylish modern spin. But while the layout suggests a flavour of yesteryear, you should not expect much in the cultural realm. X\u012bnti\u0101nd\u00ec doesn\u2019t deliver any of the lived-in charm of Ti\u00e1nz\u01d0f\u00e1ng or the creaking, rickety simplicity of the Old Town. Beyond two worthwhile sights \u2013 the Sh\u00edk\u00f9m\u00e9n Open House Museum and the Site of the 1st National Congress of the CCP \u2013 it\u2019s best for strolling the prettified alleyways and enjoying a summer evening over drinks or a meal."

    "introduction": [
        "Ringed by a 52m-wide moat at the very heart of B\u011bij\u012bng, the Forbidden City is China\u2019s largest and best-preserved collection of ancient buildings, and the largest palace complex in the world. So called because it was off limits for 500 years, when it was steeped in stultifying ritual and Byzantine regal protocol, the other-worldly palace was the reclusive home to two dynasties of imperial rule until the Republic overthrew the last Qing emperor. It has been Unesco World Heritage\u2013listed site since 1987.",
        "The Forbidden City is prosaically known as the Palace Museum (\u6545\u5bab\u535a\u7269\u9986; G\u00f9g\u014dng B\u00f3w\u00f9gu\u01cen), although most Chinese people simply call it G\u00f9 G\u014dng (\u6545\u5bab; Ancient Palace). 'Forbidden City' is an approximation of the Chinese \u7d2b\u7981\u57ce (Z\u01d0j\u00ecn Ch\u00e9ng), a more poetic moniker that also references the colour purple and the cosmically significant North Star, the \u2018celestial seat\u2019 of the emperor.",
        "In former ages the price for uninvited admission was instant execution, although mere mortals wouldn't have even got close because the Imperial City enclosing the Forbidden City with yet another set of huge walls was also off limits to ordinary citizens. These days \u00a540 or \u00a560 will do. Allow yourself the best part of a day for exploration or several trips if you\u2019re an enthusiast.",
        "There are official guides from \u00a5200 to \u00a5400 depending on how much you want to cover (inclusive for up to five people), but the automatically activated audio tours are cheaper (\u00a540; more than 40 languages) and more reliable. Restaurants, a cafe, toilets and even ATMs can be found within the palace grounds. Wheelchairs (\u00a5500 deposit) are free to use, as are pushchairs/strollers (\u00a5300 deposit).",
        "Entrance",
        "Tourists must enter through the Meridian Gate, a massive U-shaped portal at the south end of the complex, which in former times was reserved for the use of the emperor. Gongs and bells would sound imperial comings and goings, while lesser mortals used lesser gates: the military used the west gate, civilians the east gate and servants the north gate. The emperor also reviewed his armies from here, passed judgement on prisoners, announced the new year\u2019s calendar and oversaw the flogging of troublesome ministers. Up top is the Meridian Gate Gallery, which hosts temporary cultural exhibitions for both traditional Chinese arts and from abroad.",
        "Through the Meridian Gate, you enter an enormous courtyard, and cross the Golden Stream (\u91d1\u6c34; J\u012bn Shu\u01d0) \u2013 shaped to resemble a Tartar bow and spanned by five marble bridges \u2013 on your way to the magnificent Gate of Supreme Harmony. This courtyard could hold an imperial audience of 100,000 people. For an idea of the size of the restoration challenge, note how the crumbling courtyard stones are stuffed with dry weeds, especially on the periphery.",
        "First Side Galleries",
        "Before you pass through the Gate of Supreme Harmony to reach the Forbidden City\u2019s star attractions, veer off to the east and west of the huge courtyard to visit the Calligraphy and Painting Gallery inside the Hall of Martial Valor and the particularly good Ceramics Gallery, housed inside the creaking Hall of Literary Glory.",
        "Three Great Halls",
        "Raised on a three-tier marble terrace with balustrades are the Three Great Halls, the glorious heart of the Forbidden City. The recently restored Hall of Supreme Harmony is the most important and largest structure in the Forbidden City. Built in the 15th century and restored in the 17th century, it was used for ceremonial occasions, such as the emperor\u2019s birthday, the nomination of military leaders and coronations. Inside the Hall of Supreme Harmony is a richly decorated Dragon Throne (\u9f99\u6905; L\u00f3ngy\u01d0), from which the emperor would preside over trembling officials. The entire court had to touch the floor nine times with their foreheads (the custom known as kowtowing) in the emperor\u2019s presence. At the back of the throne is a carved Xumishan, the Buddhist paradise, signifying the throne\u2019s supremacy.",
        "Behind the Hall of Supreme Harmony is the smaller Hall of Middle Harmony, which was used as the emperor\u2019s transit lounge. Here he would make last-minute preparations, rehearse speeches and receive close ministers. On display are two Qing dynasty sedan chairs, the emperor\u2019s mode of transport around the Forbidden City. The last of the Qing emperors, Puyi, used a bicycle and altered a few features of the palace grounds to make it easier to get around.",
        "The third of the Great Halls is the Hall of Preserving Harmony, used for banquets and later for imperial examinations. The hall has no support pillars. To its rear is a 250-tonne marble imperial carriageway carved with dragons and clouds, which was transported into B\u011bij\u012bng on an ice path. The emperor used to be carried over this carriageway in his sedan chair as he ascended or descended the terrace. The outer housing surrounding the Three Great Halls was used for storing gold, silver, silks, carpets and other treasures.",
        "A string of side halls on the eastern and western flanks of the Three Great Halls usually, but not always, house a series of excellent exhibitions, ranging from scientific instruments and articles of daily use to objects presented to the emperor by visiting dignitaries. One contains an interesting diorama of the whole complex.",
        "Lesser Central Halls",
        "The basic configuration of the Three Great Halls is echoed by the next group of buildings. Smaller in scale, these buildings were more important in terms of real power, which in China traditionally lies at the back door.",
        "The first structure is the Palace of Heavenly Purity, a residence of Ming and early Qing emperors, and later an audience hall for receiving foreign envoys and high officials.",
        "Immediately behind it is the Hall of Union, which contains a clepsydra \u2013 a water clock made in 1745 with five bronze vessels and a calibrated scale. There\u2019s also a mechanical clock built in 1797 and a collection of imperial jade seals on display. The Palace of Earthly Tranquillity was the imperial couple\u2019s bridal chamber and the centre of operations for the palace harem.",
        "Imperial Garden",
        "At the northern end of the Forbidden City is the Imperial Garden, a classical Chinese garden with 7000 sq metres of fine landscaping, including rockeries, walkways, pavilions and ancient cypresses. Before you reach the Gate of Divine Prowess, the Forbidden City\u2019s north exit, and Sh\u00f9nzh\u0113n Gate, which leads to it, note the pair of bronze elephants whose front knees bend in an anatomically impossible fashion, signifying the power of the emperor.",
        "Treasure Gallery",
        "In the northeastern corner of the complex is a mini Forbidden City known as the Treasure Gallery, or Complete Palace of Peace and Longevity (\u5b81\u5bff\u5168\u5bab; N\u00edng Sh\u01d2u Qu\u00e1n G\u014dng). During the Ming dynasty, the Empress Dowager and the imperial concubines lived here. Today it comprises a number of atmospheric halls, pavilions, gardens and courtyard buildings that hold a collection of fine museums.",
        "The complex is entered from the south \u2013 not far from the Clock Exhibition Hall. Just inside the entrance, you\u2019ll find the beautiful glazed Nine Dragon Screen, one of only three of its type left in China.",
        "Visitors then work their way north, exploring a number of peaceful halls and courtyards before being popped out at the northern end of the Forbidden City. Don\u2019t miss the Pavilion of Cheerful Melodies, a three-storey wooden opera house, which was the palace\u2019s largest theatre. Note the trap doors that allowed actors to make dramatic stage entrances.",
        "Western & Eastern Palaces",
        "A dozen smaller palace courtyards lie to the west and east of the three lesser central halls. It was in these smaller courtyard buildings that most of the emperors actually lived and many of the buildings, particularly those to the west, are decked out in imperial furniture. Those that are open to the public have cultural exhibitions displaying anything from temple musical instruments to ceremonial bronze vessels and ceramics."

    "introduction": [
        "A tranquil oasis of peace and methodical Confucian design in one of China\u2019s busiest urban landscapes, the 267-hectare Temple of Heaven Park is absolutely unique. It originally served as a vast stage for solemn rites performed by the emperor of the time (known as the Son of Heaven), who prayed here for good harvests and sought divine clearance and atonement. Strictly speaking, it's an altar rather than a temple \u2013 so don\u2019t expect burning incense or worshippers.",
        "Surrounded by a long wall and with a gate at each compass point, the arrangement is typical of Chinese parks, with the imperfections, bumps and wild irregularities of nature largely deleted and the harmonising hand of man accentuated in obsessively straight lines and regular arrangements. This effect is magnified by Confucian objectives, where the human intellect is imposed on the natural world, fashioning order and symmetry. The resulting balance and harmony have an almost haunting \u2013 but slightly claustrophobic \u2013 beauty. Police whir about in electric buggies as visitors stroll among old buildings, groves of ancient trees and birdsong. Around 4000 ancient, knotted cypresses (some 800 years old, their branches propped up on poles) poke towards the B\u011bij\u012bng skies within the grounds.",
        "Seen from above, the temple halls are round and the bases square, in accordance with the notion \u2018Ti\u0101nyu\u00e1n D\u00ecf\u0101ng\u2019 (\u5929\u5706\u5730\u65b9) \u2013 \u2018Heaven is round, Earth is square\u2019. Also observe that the northern rim of the park is semicircular, while its southern end is square. The traditional approach to the temple was from the south, via Zh\u0101oh\u0113ng Gate (\u662d\u4ea8\u95e8; Zh\u0101oh\u0113ng M\u00e9n); the north gate is an architectural afterthought. The highlight of the park, and an icon of B\u011bij\u012bng in its own right, is the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, an astonishing structure with a triple-eaved purplish-blue umbrella roof mounted on a three-tiered marble terrace. The wooden pillars (made from Oregon fir) support the ceiling without nails or cement \u2013 for a building 38m high and 30m in diameter, that\u2019s quite an accomplishment. Embedded in the ceiling is a carved dragon, a symbol of the emperor. Built in 1420, the hall was reduced to carbon after being zapped by a lightning bolt during the reign of Guangxu in 1889; a faithful reproduction based on Ming architectural methods was erected the following year.",
        "Continuing south along an elevated imperial pathway, you soon reach the octagonal Imperial Vault of Heaven, which was erected in 1530 and rebuilt in 1752, but with its shape echoing the lines of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests. The hall contained tablets of the emperor\u2019s ancestors, employed during winter solstice ceremonies.",
        "Wrapped around the Imperial Vault of Heaven is Echo Wall. A whisper can travel clearly from one end to your friend\u2019s ear at the other \u2013 unless a cacophonous tour group joins in (get here early for this one).",
        "Immediately south of Echo Wall, the 5m-high Round Altar was constructed at the same time as the Imperial Vault of Heaven and rebuilt in 1740. Consisting of white marble arrayed in three tiers, its geometry revolves around the imperial number nine. Odd numbers possess heavenly significance, with nine the largest single-digit odd number. Symbolising heaven, the top tier is a huge mosaic of nine rings, each composed of multiples of nine stones, so that the ninth ring equals 81 stones. The stairs and balustrades are similarly presented in multiples of nine. Sounds generated from the centre of the upper terrace undergo amplification from the marble balustrades (the acoustics can get noisy when crowds join in).",
        "Off to the eastern side of the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, and with a green-tiled two-tier roof, the Animal Killing Pavilion was the venue for the slaughter of sacrificial oxen, sheep, deer and other animals. Today it stands locked and passive but can be admired from the outside. Stretching out from here runs a Long Corridor, where locals sit and deal cards, listen to the radio, play keyboards, practise Peking opera, try dance moves and play ji\u00e0nzi, a game similar to hacky-sack but played with a weighted shuttlecock. Just north of here is a large and very popular exercise park.",
        "In the west of the park, sacrificial music was rehearsed at the Divine Music Administration, while feral cats inhabit the dry moat of the green-tiled Fasting Palace.",
        "The East Gate is the most popular place to enter the park but queues for tickets are shorter at the West Gate."

    "introduction": [
        "As mandatory a B\u011bij\u012bng sight as the Great Wall or the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace was the playground for emperors fleeing the suffocating summer torpor of the old imperial city. A marvel of design, the palace \u2013 with its huge lake and hilltop views \u2013 offers a pastoral escape into the landscapes of traditional Chinese painting. It merits an entire day\u2019s exploration, although a (high-paced) morning or afternoon exploring the temples, gardens, pavilions, bridges and corridors may suffice.",
        "The domain had long been a royal garden before being considerably enlarged and embellished by Emperor Qianlong in the 18th century. He marshalled a 100,000-strong army of labourers to deepen and expand K\u016bnm\u00edng Lake (\u6606\u660e\u6e56; K\u016bnm\u00edng H\u00fa), and reputedly surveyed imperial navy drills from a hilltop perch.",
        "Anglo-French troops vandalised the palace during the Second Opium War (1856\u201360). Empress Dowager Cixi launched into a refit in 1888 with money earmarked for a modern navy; the marble boat at the northern edge of the lake was her only nautical, albeit quite unsinkable, concession. Foreign troops, angered by the Boxer Rebellion, had another go at torching the Summer Palace in 1900, prompting further restoration work. By 1949 the palace had once more fallen into disrepair, eliciting a major overhaul.",
        "Glittering K\u016bnm\u00edng Lake swallows up three-quarters of the park, overlooked by Longevity Hill (\u4e07\u5bff\u5c71; W\u00e0nsh\u00f2u Sh\u0101n). The principal structure is the Hall of Benevolence & Longevity, by the east gate, housing a hardwood throne and attached to a courtyard decorated with bronze animals, including the mythical q\u00edl\u00edn (a hybrid animal that only appeared on earth at times of harmony). Unfortunately, the hall is barricaded so you can only peer in.",
        "An elegant stretch of woodwork along the northern shore, the Long Corridor is trimmed with a plethora of paintings, while the slopes and crest of Longevity Hill behind are adorned with Buddhist temples. Slung out uphill on a north\u2013south axis, the Buddhist Fragrance Pavilion and the Cloud Dispelling Hall are linked by corridors. Crowning the peak is the Buddhist Temple of the Sea of Wisdom, tiled with effigies of Buddha, many with obliterated heads.",
        "Cixi\u2019s marble boat sits immobile on the north shore, south of some fine Qing boathouses. When the lake is not frozen, you can traverse K\u016bnm\u00edng Lake by ferry to South Lake Island (\u5357\u6e56\u5c9b; N\u00e1nh\u00fa D\u01ceo), where Cixi went to beseech the Dragon King Temple for rain in times of drought. A graceful 17-arch bridge spans the 150m to the eastern shore of the lake. In warm weather pedal boats are also available from the dock.",
        "Try to do a circuit of the lake along the West Causeway to return along the east shore (or vice versa). It gets you away from the crowds, the views are gorgeous and it\u2019s a great cardiovascular workout. Based on the Su Causeway in H\u00e1ngzh\u014du, and lined with willow and mulberry trees, the causeway kicks off just west of the boathouses. With its delightful hump, the grey- and white-marble Jade Belt Bridge dates from the reign of emperor Qianlong and crosses the point where the Jade River enters the lake (when it flows).",
        "Towards the North Palace Gate, S\u016bzh\u014du Street (\u82cf\u5dde\u8857; S\u016bzh\u014du Ji\u0113) is an entertaining and light-hearted diversion of riverside walkways, shops and eateries, which are designed to mimic the famous Ji\u0101ngs\u016b canal town."

The industrial complex celebrates its proletarian roots in the communist heyday of the 1950s via the retouched red Maoist slogans decorating gallery walls and statues of burly, lantern-jawed workers dotting the lanes. The giant former factory workshops are ideally suited to multimedia installations and other ambitious projects.",

The Danish gallery Faurschou Foundation Beijing has exhibitions by internationally acclaimed artists, with past shows including the likes of Lucien Freud, Ai Wei Wei, Andy Warhol and Yoko Ono.

Each of the Bodhisattva\u2019s toes is the size of a pillow. Behind the statue is the Vault of Avalokiteshvara, from where a diminutive and blue-faced statue of Guanyin peeks out. The W\u00e0nf\u00fa Pavilion is linked by an overhead walkway to the Y\u00e1nsu\u00ed Pavilion (Y\u00e1nsu\u00ed G\u00e9), which encloses a huge lotus flower that revolves to reveal an effigy of the Longevity Buddha.",

Also peruse the collection of Tibetan Buddhist ornaments within the B\u0101nch\u00e1n L\u00f3u, another side hall, where an array of dorje (Tibetan sceptres), mandalas and tantric figures are displayed along with an impressive selection of ceremonial robes in silk and satin.",

        "Flanked by stern 1950s Soviet-style buildings and ringed by white perimeter fences, the world\u2019s largest public square (440,000 sq metres) is an immense flatland of paving stones at the heart of B\u011bij\u012bng. If you get up early, you can watch the flag-raising ceremony at sunrise, performed by a troop of People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers drilled to march at precisely 108 paces per minute, 75cm per pace. The soldiers emerge through the Gate of Heavenly Peace to goose-step impeccably across Chang\u2019an Jie; all traffic is halted. The same ceremony in reverse is performed at sunset.",
        "Here one stands at the symbolic centre of the Chinese universe. The rectangular arrangement, flanked by halls to both east and west, to some extent echoes the layout of the Forbidden City: as such, the square employs a conventional plan that pays obeisance to traditional Chinese culture, but many of its ornaments and buildings are Soviet-inspired. Mao conceived the square to project the enormity of the Communist Party, and during the Cultural Revolution he reviewed parades of up to a million people here. The \u2018Ti\u0101n\u2019\u0101nm\u00e9n Incident\u2019, in 1976, is the term given to the near-riot in the square that accompanied the death of Premier Zhou Enlai. Another million people jammed the square to pay their last respects to Mao in the same year. Most infamously, in 1989 the army forced prodemocracy demonstrators out of the square. Hundreds lost their lives in the surrounding streets, although contrary to widespread belief, it is unlikely that anyone was killed in the square itself.",
        "Despite being a public place, the square remains more in the hands of the government than the people; it is monitored by closed circuit TV cameras, Segway-riding policemen and plain-clothes officers. The designated points of access, security checks on entry (expect a lengthy wait) and twitchy mood cleave Ti\u0101n\u2019\u0101nm\u00e9n Sq from the city. A tangible atmosphere of restraint and authority reigns.",
        "All this \u2013 plus the absence of anywhere to sit \u2013 means the square is hardly a place to chill out (don\u2019t whip out a guitar), but such is its iconic status that few people leave B\u011bij\u012bng without making a visit. In any case, there\u2019s more than enough space to stretch a leg and the view can be breathtaking, especially on a clear blue day or at nightfall when the area is illuminated."

The Bell Tower looks the older of the two, perhaps because it isn\u2019t painted. In fact both are of similar age. The Bell Tower was built during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, in 1272, and was rebuilt in the 1440s after being destroyed in a fire. This current structure was built in 1745.",
        "Like the Drum Tower, the Bell Tower can also be climbed up an incredibly steep inner staircase. But the views from the top are even better here, partly because the structure is set back more deeply into the surrounding h\u00fat\u00f2ng, and partly because you can get great photos of the Drum Tower from its viewing balcony. Marvel, too, at the huge, 600-year-old, 63-tonne bell suspended in the pleasantly unrestored interior. Note how Chinese bells have no clappers but are instead struck with a stout pole.",
        "Inside the tower, on the ground floor (south side), is the Bell Tower Tea House, where you can sample a selection of Chinese teas as well as buy tea and tea sets.",
        "The Drum & Bell Sq, between the two towers, is a great people-watching area in which to while away some time even if you don\u2019t climb either of the two towers. Both towers are lit up beautifully come evening."

An architectural wonder even by modern standards, the palace rises 13 storeys from 130m-high Marpo Ri (Red Hill) and contains more than 1000 rooms. Pilgrims and tourists alike shuffle open-mouthed through the three storeys, past the dozens of magnificent chapels, golden stupas and prayer halls.",
        "The first recorded use of the site was in the 7th century AD, when King Songtsen Gampo built a palace here. Construction of the present structure began during the reign of the fifth Dalai Lama in 1645 and took divisions of labourers and artisans more than 50 years to complete. It is impressive enough to have caused Chinese premier Zhou Enlai to send his own troops to protect it from the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.",
        "The layout of the Potala Palace includes the rooftop White Palace (the eastern part of the building), used for the living quarters of the Dalai Lama, and the central Red Palace, used for religious functions. The most stunning chapels of the Red Palace house the jewel-bedecked golden ch\u00f6rten (Tibetan stupa) tombs of several previous Dalai Lamas. The apartments of the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas, in the White Palace, offer a more personal insight into palace life.",

However, another image, the Jowa Sakyamuni, was later moved here by the king's other wife (the Chinese Princess Wencheng), and it is this image that gives the Jokhang both its name and its spiritual potency: Jokhang means 'chapel of the Jowo'.",

To the left of the Jampa statue, in the corner, is a wooden Kalachakra mandala. The walls are stacked with the collected works of Tsongkhapa (founder of the Gelugpa order) and the fifth Dalai Lama. The chapel was damaged in a fire (caused by an electrical fault) in 1984 and many valuable thangkas (religious paintings) were lost.",

These are essentially three-dimensional versions of the mandalas you see painted on thangkas everywhere in Tibet and act as meditation maps for the mind.",

        "In the northwestern corner is the Lama Lhakhang and the golden tomb of the Seventh Dalai Lama (Serdung Tashi Obar Khang), constructed in 1757 and encased in half a tonne of gold. To the right stands a half-hidden statue of Kalsang Gyatso, the seventh Dalai Lama.",
        "Also in the northwestern corner, steps lead up into the small but important Chapel of Arya Lokeshvara (Phagpa Lhakhang). It is said that this is one of the few corners of the Potala that dates from the time of Songtsen Gampo\u2019s 7th-century palace. It is the most sacred of the Potala\u2019s chapels, and the sandalwood image of Arya Lokeshvara inside is the most revered image housed in the Potala.

The most important statue is of Songtsen Gampo himself, to the left of the pillar. To the left is his minister Tonmi Sambhota (said to have invented the Tibetan script) and to the right are his Chinese and Nepali wives. A statue of the king\u2019s Tibetan wife, Mongsa Tricham (the only one to bear a son), is in a cabinet by the door. The fifth Dalai Lama lurks behind (and also on) the central pillar. Also here is Gar Tsongtsen, the Tibetan prime minister (and Songtsen Gampo's right-hand man), who travelled to the Tang court to escort Princess Wencheng back to Lhasa. Queues for this chapel can be long.",
        "The last three rooms are all linked and are chock-a-block full of 3000 pieces of priceless statuary, many donated by a Khampa businessman in 1995.",

The large throne that dominates one end of the hall was the throne of the sixth Dalai Lama. Four important chapels frame the hall.",
        "The first chapel on this floor is the Chapel of Lamrim. Lamrim means \u2018the graduated path\u2019 and refers to the stages that mark the path to enlightenment. The central figure in the chapel is Tsongkhapa, with whom lamrim texts are usually associated. Outside the chapel, to the left, a fine mural depicts the Forbidden City, commemorating the fifth Dalai Lama\u2019s visit to the court of Emperor Shunzhi in 1652. Murals depict the tent camps used by the court on its journey across Tibet.",
        "The next chapel, the long Rigzin Lhakhang, is dedicated to eight Indian teachers who brought various Tantric practices and rituals to Tibet. The central figure is a silver statue of Guru Rinpoche (one of the eight), who is flanked by his consorts Mandarava and Yeshe Tsogyel (with a turquoise headdress), as well as statues of the eight teachers to the left and further statues on the right of the guru in the eight manifestations known as the Guru Tsengye. As you exit the chapel, take an up-close look at the fine wall murals.",
        "In the west wing of the assembly hall is one of the highlights of the Potala, the awe-inspiring Chapel of the Dalai Lamas\u2019 Tombs (Serdung Zamling Gyenjikhang). The hall is dominated by the huge 12.6m-high ch\u00f6rten of the great fifth Dalai Lama, gilded with some 3.7kg of gold. Flanking it are two smaller ch\u00f6rtens containing the 10th and 12th Dalai Lamas, who both died as children. Richly embossed, the ch\u00f6rtens represent the concentrated wealth of an entire nation. One of the precious stones is a pearl said to have been discovered in an elephant\u2019s brain and thus, in a wonderful piece of understatement, \u2018considered a rarity\u2019. Eight other ch\u00f6rtens represent the eight major events in the life of the Buddha.",
        "The last chapel is the Chapel of the Holy Born (Trungrab Lhakhang). First, in the corner, is the statue and ch\u00f6rten of the 11th Dalai Lama, who died at the age of 17. There are also statues of the eight medicine buddhas with their characteristic blue hair, a central golden Sakyamuni and the fifth Dalai Lama (silver), and then Chenresig, Songtsen Gampo, Dromt\u00f6npa (founder of the Kadampa order) and the first four Dalai Lamas."

Despite the stream of selfie-taking tourists, the atmosphere is one of occupation or siege.",
        "Close to the entrance to the Jokhang a constant stream of Tibetans follows the Barkhor circumambulation route in a clockwise direction. Look for the two pot-bellied stone sangkang (incense burners) in front of the Jokhang. There are four sangkang, marking the four extremities of the Barkhor circuit; the other two are at the rear of the Jokhang.",
        "Behind the first two sangkang are two joined enclosures. The northern stele is inscribed with the terms of the Sino-Tibetan treaty of 822. The dual-language inscription delimits the Chinese\u2013Tibetan border and guarantees mutual respect of the borders of the two nations, an irony given the political situation over the last 50 years. The southern enclosure harbours an ancient willow tree, known as the hair of the Jowo \u2013 according to legend, it was planted by Songtsen Gampo\u2019s Chinese wife, Princess Wencheng \u2013 and two stele, one of which was erected in 1793 to commemorate the victims of a smallpox epidemic. Over the centuries Tibetans have chiselled out chunks of this stele for its purported protective medicinal properties."

        "The Terracotta Army isn't just X\u012b'\u0101n's premier sight, it's one of the most famous archaeological finds in the world. This subterranean life-size army of thousands has silently stood guard over the soul of China's first unifier for more than two millennia. Either Qin Shi Huang was terrified of the vanquished spirits awaiting him in the afterlife, or as most archaeologists believe, he expected his rule to continue in death as it had in life.",
        "Whatever the case, the guardians of his tomb today offer some of the greatest insights we have into the world of ancient China.",
        "The discovery of the army of warriors was entirely fortuitous. In 1974, peasants drilling a well uncovered an underground vault that eventually yielded thousands of terracotta soldiers and horses in battle formation. Throughout the years the site became so famous that many of its unusual attributes are now well known, in particular the fact that no two soldier's faces are alike.",
        "The on-site wrap-around theatre gives a useful primer on how the figures were sculpted. You can also employ a guide (low/high season \u00a5150/200) or try the audio guide (\u00a540, plus \u00a5200 deposit), although the latter is somewhat useless, being difficult to understand and not very compelling.",
        "Then visit the site in reverse, which enables you to build up to the most impressive pit for a fitting finale.",
        "Start with the smallest pit, Pit 3, containing 72 warriors and horses; it's believed to be the army headquarters due to the number of high-ranking officers unearthed here. It's interesting to note that the northern room would have been used to make sacrificial offerings before battle. In the next pit, Pit 2, containing around 1300 warriors and horses, you can examine five of the soldiers up close: a kneeling archer, a standing archer, a cavalryman and his horse, a mid-ranking officer and a general. The level of detail is extraordinary: the expressions, hairstyles, armour and even the tread on the footwear are all unique.",
        "The largest pit, Pit 1, is the most imposing. Housed in a building the size of an aircraft hangar, it is believed to contain 6000 warriors (only 2000 are on display) and horses, all facing east and ready for battle. The vanguard of three rows of archers (both crossbow and longbow) is followed by the main force of soldiers, who originally held spears, swords, dagger-axes and other long-shaft weapons. The infantry were accompanied by 35 chariots, though these, made of wood, have long since disintegrated.",
        "Almost as extraordinary as the soldiers is a pair of bronze chariots and horses unearthed just 20m west of the Tomb of Qin Shi Huang. These are now on display, together with some of the original weaponry and a mid-ranking officer you can see up close in a huge modern museum called the Qin Shi Huang Emperor Tomb Artefact Exhibition Hall (\u79e6\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d\u9675\u6587\u7269\u9648\u5217\u5385; Q\u01d0nsh\u01d0hu\u00e1ngd\u00ecl\u00edng Ch\u00e9nli\u00e8t\u012bng).",
        "You can take photographs, although signs forbid using flash photography (widely ignored) or tripods (also ignored by some).",
        "Among rather tacky souvenir offerings, you can get your own warrior statue personalised with your own face (\u00a5100) or have a photo taken next to a fake warrior (\u00a510). You can also pick up all manner of terracotta ornamentation \u2013 from warrior paperweights to life-size statues \u2013 from the souvenir shop in the theatre building. There's also a Friendship Store for jade, jewellery and so forth.",
        "The Army of the Terracotta Warriors is easily reached by public bus. From X\u012b'\u0101n train station take one of the air-conditioned buses, either 914 or 915 (\u00a58, one hour), which depart every four minutes from 6am to 7pm. Take the bus to the last stop; the buses also travel via the Hu\u00e1q\u012bng Hot Springs and the Tomb of Qin Shi Huang. The car park for the vehicles is a 15-minute walk from the site, but you can take an electric buggy (\u00a55) instead if you want. If you want to eat here, there's a good cafe in the theatre building and after you exit to walk back to the car and bus park, you will take another route past a whole assortment of restaurants and fast food, including a McDonald's. Buses head back to town from the parking lot."

The older section is worth a visit and you can join the queue of pilgrims who shuffle past the finger bone. The real reason to make the trip out here is the superb museum and its collection of Tang-dynasty treasures.",
        "There are elaborate gold and silver boxes (stacked on top of one another to form pagodas) and tiny crystal and jade coffins that originally contained the four separated sections of the holy finger.",
        "In 1981, after torrential rains had weakened the temple\u2019s ancient brick structure, the entire western side of its 12-storey pagoda collapsed. The subsequent restoration of the temple produced a sensational discovery. Below the pagoda in a sealed crypt were more than 1000 sacrificial objects and royal offerings \u2013 all forgotten for over a millennium.",
        "Sensing a cash cow, local authorities began enlarging the temple complex and it now includes a sprawling modern section featuring a 1.6km-long walkway lined with 10 golden Buddhas, eccentric modern sculptures and outsized gates. Shuttle buses (\u00a520) whisk the pious to the main temple, topped with an enormous replica of the box in which the finger bone was kept. Despite the overblown enlargements, for Buddhists this is a very sacred place.",

        "Originally a lagoon adjoining the Qi\u00e1nt\u00e1ng River, the lake didn\u2019t come into existence until the 8th century, when the governor of H\u00e1ngzh\u014du had the marshy expanse dredged. As time passed, the lake\u2019s splendour was gradually cultivated: gardens were planted, pagodas built, and causeways and islands were constructed from dredged silt.",
        "Celebrated poet Su Dongpo himself had a hand in the lake\u2019s development, constructing the S\u016b Causeway (\u82cf\u5824; S\u016bd\u012b) during his tenure as local governor in the 11th century. It wasn\u2019t an original idea \u2013 the poet-governor Bai Juyi had already constructed the B\u00e1i Causeway (\u767d\u5824; B\u00e1id\u012b) some 200 years earlier. Lined by willow, plum and peach trees, today the traffic-free causeways with their half-moon bridges make for restful outings.",

It\u2019s been said that her ghost haunts the area and the tinkle of the bells on her gown are audible at night.",
        "The smaller island in the lake is Xi\u01ceoy\u00edng Island, where you can look over at Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, three small towers in the water on the south side of the island; each has five holes that release shafts of candlelight on the night of the mid-autumn festival. From Lesser Y\u00edngzh\u014du Island, you can gaze over to Red Carp Pond, home to a few thousand red carp.",

        "X\u012b'\u0101n is one of the few cities in China where the imposing old city walls still stand. Built in 1370 during the Ming dynasty, the magnificent 12m-high walls are surrounded by a dry moat and form a rectangle with a perimeter of 14km. Most sections have been restored or rebuilt, and it is possible to walk the walls in their entirety in a leisurely four hours (or around two hours by bike, or at a slow jog).",
        "Cycling from the South Gate costs \u00a540 for 100 minutes (\u00a5200 deposit), while the truly lazy can be whisked around in a golf cart for \u00a5200. Access ramps are located inside the major gates, with the exception of the South Gate, where the entrance is outside the walls; there's another entrance inside the walls beside the Forest of Stelae Museum. En route, you get to look out over modern-day X\u012b'\u0101n. From this vantage point it's clear that the city is a hodgepodge of old and new, with the new vastly in the ascendancy. Every now and then a slice of old X\u012b'\u0101n, such as Gu\u01cengr\u00e9n Temple, appears and you are rewarded with a bird's-eye view.",
        "To get an idea of X\u012b'\u0101n's former grandeur, consider this: the Tang city walls originally enclosed 83 sq km, an area seven times larger than today's city centre."

As a sacred Tibetan Buddhist place of worship, the temple hums with mystery and spiritual energy.

        "Facing west (towards Mecca) instead of the customary south, the mosque features classic Chinese temple features, including spirit walls, designed to keep demons at bay, stelae on the backs of antediluvian bixi (mythical tortoise-like creatures usually seen populating Confucian temples) and memorial arches, not to mention the glazed-tile Chinese-style roofing. The gardens, too, with their rocks, pagodas and archways are clearly Chinese. The presence of the mosque's white-capped Hui custodians is a constant reminder, however, of its Muslim purpose.",

        "This grand Gothic palace was the Doge's official residence from the 9th century, and seat of the Venetian Republic's government (and prisons) for nearly seven centuries. The Doge's Apartments are on the 1st floor, but it's the lavishly decorated 2nd-floor chambers that are the real highlight. These culminate in the echoing Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Grand Council Hall), home to the Doge\u2019s throne and a 22m-by-7m Paradise painting by Tintoretto\u2019s son Domenico.",
        "After fire gutted the original palace in 1577, Venice considered Palladio\u2019s offer to build one of his signature neoclassical temples in its place. Instead, Antonio da Ponte won the commission to restore the palace's Gothic facade with white Istrian stone and Veronese pink marble. Da Ponte's palazzo effortlessly mixes past with present and business with pleasure, capping a graceful colonnade with medieval capitals depicting key Venetian guilds.",
        "Climb the Scala dei Censori (Stairs of the Censors) to the Doge\u2019s Apartments on the first floor. The 18 roaring lions decorating the doge's Sala degli Stucci are reminders that Venice's most powerful figurehead lived like a caged lion in his gilded suite, which he could not leave without permission. Still, consider the real estate: a terrace garden with private entry to the basilica, and a dozen salons with splendidly restored marble fireplaces carved by Tullio and Antonio Lombardo. The Sala del Scudo (Shield Room) is covered with world maps that reveal the extents of Venetian power c 1483 and 1762.",
        "Ascend Sansovino\u2019s 24-carat gilt stuccowork Scala d\u2019Oro (Golden Staircase) and emerge into second floor rooms covered with gorgeous propaganda. In the Palladio-designed Sala delle Quattro Porte (Hall of the Four Doors), ambassadors awaited ducal audiences under a lavish display of Venice's virtues by Giovanni Cambi, Titian and Tiepolo.",
        "Few were granted an audience in the Palladio-designed Collegio (Council Room), where Veronese\u2019s 1575\u201378 Virtues of the Republic ceiling shows Venice as a bewitching blonde waving her sceptre like a wand over Justice and Peace. Father-son team Jacopo and Domenico Tintoretto attempt similar flattery, showing Venice keeping company with Apollo, Mars and Mercury in their Triumph of Venice ceiling for the Sala del Senato (Senate Hall).",
        "Government cover-ups were never so appealing as in the Sala Consiglio dei Dieci (Trial Chambers of the Council of Ten), where Venice\u2019s star chamber plotted under Veronese\u2019s Juno Bestowing Her Gifts on Venice, a glowing goddess strewing gold ducats. Over the slot where anonymous treason accusations were slipped into the Sala della Bussola (Compass Room) is his St Mark in Glory ceiling.",
        "The cavernous 1419 Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Grand Council Hall) provides the setting for Domenico Tintoretto's swirling Paradise, a work that\u2019s more politically correct than pretty: heaven is crammed with 500 prominent Venetians, including several Tintoretto patrons. Veronese\u2019s political posturing is more elegant in his oval Apotheosis of Venice ceiling, where gods marvel at Venice\u2019s coronation by angels, with foreign dignitaries and Venetian blondes rubbernecking on the balcony below."

        "With its Byzantine domes and 8500 sq metres of luminous mosaics, Venice's basilica is an unforgettable sight. It dates to the 9th century when, according to legend, two merchants smuggled the corpse of St Mark out of Egypt in a barrel of pork fat. When the original burnt down in 932 Venice rebuilt the basilica in its own cosmopolitan image, with Byzantine domes, a Greek cross layout and walls clad in marbles from Syria, Egypt and Palestine.",
        "The front of the basilica ripples and crests like a wave, its five niched portals capped with shimmering mosaics and frothy stonework arches. In the far-left portal, lunette mosaics dating from 1270 show St Mark\u2019s stolen body arriving at the basilica. Grand entrances are made through the central portal, under an ornate triple arch with Egyptian purple porphyry columns and 13th- to 14th-century reliefs of vines, virtues and astrological signs.",
        "Blinking is natural upon your first glimpse of the basilica's glittering mosaics, many made with 24-carat gold leaf fused onto the back of the glass to represent divine light. Just inside the vestibule are the basilica's oldest mosaics: Apostles with the Madonna, standing sentry by the main door for more than 950 years. Mystical transfusions occur in the Dome of the Holy Spirit, where a dove\u2019s blood streams onto the heads of saints. In the central 13th-century Cupola of the Ascension, angels swirl overhead while dreamy-eyed St Mark rests on the pendentive. Scenes from St Mark\u2019s life unfold over the main altar, in vaults flanking the Dome of the Prophets.",
        "The latter is best seen from the Pala d\u2019Oro, a gold altarpiece studded with 2000 emeralds, amethysts, sapphires, rubies, pearls and other gemstones. It houses the sarcophagus of St Mark's and is guarded by wide-eyed saints in vibrant cloisonn\u00e9, begun in Constantinople in AD 976 and elaborated by Venetian goldsmiths in 1209. Other holy bones and booty from the Crusades fill the Tesoro; while ducal treasures on show in the museum would put a king\u2019s ransom to shame. A highlight is the Quadriga of St Mark's, a group of four bronze horses originally plundered from Constantinople and later carted off to Paris by Napoleon before being returned to the basilica and installed in the 1st-floor gallery. Portals lead from the gallery on to the Loggia dei Cavalli, where reproductions of the horses gallop off the balcony over Piazza San Marco.",
        "The roped-off circuit of the church interior is free and takes about 15 minutes. For entry, dress modestly (ie knees and shoulders covered) and leave large bags around the corner at Ateneo di San Basso's free one-hour baggage storage (10am to 4.30pm).",
        "Between mid-September and October, the diocese offers free guided tours at 11.30am Monday to Friday explaining, in various languages, the theological messages in the mosaics. Reservations (041 241 38 17) are essential."

        "Guarding the entrance to the Grand Canal, this 17th-century domed church was commissioned by Venice\u2019s plague survivors as thanks for their salvation. Baldassare Longhena's uplifting design is an engineering feat that defies simple logic; in fact the church is said to have mystical curative properties. Titian eluded the plague until age 94, leaving 12 key paintings in the basilica's art-slung sacristy.",
        "Longhena's marvel makes good on an official appeal by the Venetian Senate directly to the Madonna in 1630, after 80,000 Venetians had been killed by plague brought in by a carpenter working on Venice's quarantine island, the Lazzaretto Vecchio. The Senate promised the Madonna a church in exchange for her intervention on behalf of Venice \u2013 no expense or effort spared. Before 'La Salute' could even be started, at least 100,000 pylons had to be driven deep into the barene (mud banks) to shore up the tip of Dorsoduro.",
        "The Madonna provided essential inspiration, but La Salute draws its structural strength from a range of architectural and spiritual traditions. Architectural scholars note striking similarities between Longhena's unusual domed octagon structure and both Greco-Roman goddess temples and Jewish Kabbalah diagrams. The lines of the building ingeniously converge beneath the dome to form a vortex on the inlaid marble floors, and the black dot at the centre is said to radiate healing energy.",
        "The sacristy is a wonder within a wonder, its glorious collection of Titian masterpieces including a vivid self-portrait in the guise of St Matthew and his earliest known work from 1510, Saint Mark on the Throne. Salute's most charming allegory for Venice's miraculous survival from plague is Palma Il Giovane's painting of Jonah emerging from the mouth of the whale, where the survivor stomps down the sea creature's tongue like an action hero walking the red carpet. Life in a time of plague is a miracle worth celebrating in Tintoretto\u2019s upbeat 1561 Wedding Feast of Cana, featuring a Venetian throng of multi-culti musicians, busy wine pourers, and Tintoretto himself in the pink, gently schooling a young, thin-bearded Paolo Veronese."

The artist documents Mary's life story in the assembly hall, and both Old and New Testament scenes in the Sala Grande Superiore upstairs. ",
        "In the assembly hall, Mary's life story starts on the left wall with the Annunciation and ends on the opposite wall with Tintoretto's dark, cataclysmic Ascension. From spring to late autumn, the artworks provide a bewitching backdrop to top-notch concerts of baroque music; ask at the counter or check the website for details.",
        "Upstairs in the Sala Grande Superiore, Old Testament scenes painted by Tintoretto between 1575 and 1587 read like a modern graphic novel: you can almost hear the swoop! overhead as an angel dives to feed the ailing prophet in Elijah Fed by an Angel. Mercy from above is a recurring theme, with Daniel\u2019s salvation by angels, the miraculous fall of manna in the desert, and Elisha distributing bread to the hungry. Scenes from Christ\u2019s life aren\u2019t in chronological order: birth and baptism are followed by resurrection. The drama builds as background characters disappear into increasingly dark canvases, until an X-shaped black void looms at the centre of Agony in the Garden.",

A stroll through the gardens leads to the outdoor Teatro Verde, built in the 1950s and sometimes used for summer performances.

        "Centuries of damage have left the mural in a fragile state despite 22 years of restoration, which was completed in 1999. Da Vinci himself is partly to blame: his experimental mix of oil and tempera was applied between 1495 and 1498, rather than within a week as is typical of fresco techniques. The Dominicans didn't help matters when in 1652 they raised the refectory floor, hacking off a lower section of the scene, including Jesus' feet. But the most damage was caused by restorers in the 19th century, whose use of alcohol and cotton wool removed an entire layer. But the work's condition does little to lessen its astonishing beauty. Stare at the ethereal, lucent windows beyond the narrative action and you'll wonder if da Vinci's uncharacteristic short-sightedness wasn't divinely inspired.",

        "Originally a Visconti fortress, this iconic red-brick castle was later home to the mighty Sforza dynasty, who ruled Renaissance Milan. The castle's defences were designed by the multitalented da Vinci; Napoleon later drained the moat and removed the drawbridges. Today, it houses seven specialised museums, which gather together intriguing fragments of Milan\u2019s cultural and civic history, including Michelangelo\u2019s final work, the Rondanini Piet\u00e0, now housed in the frescoed hall of the castle's Ospedale Spagnolo (Spanish Hospital).",
        "Of the museums, the most interesting is the Musei d'Arte Antica (Museum of Ancient Art), which is displayed in the ducal apartments, some of which are frescoed by Leonardo da Vinci. Included in the collection are early paleo-Christian sculptures, the superb equestrian tomb of Bernarb\u00f2 Visconti and sculpted reliefs depicting Milan's triumph over Barbarossa. The exhibit eloquently tells the story of the birth of Italy's first city comune through murderous dynastic and regional ambitions, which made this one of the most powerful courts in Europe.",
        "On the 1st floor, the Museo dei Mobile (Furniture Museum) and Pinacoteca (Picture Gallery) blend seamlessly, leading you from ducal wardrobes and writing desks through to a collection of Lombard Gothic art. Among the masterpieces are Andrea Mantegna's Trivulzio Madonna, Vincenzo Foppa's St Sebastian and Bramantino's Noli me tangere (Touch me not).",

        "Few art galleries are as prized as the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris\u2019 pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance and the world's most visited museum. The palace rambles over four floors, up and down innumerable staircases, and through three wings. Showcasing 35,000 works of art \u2013 from Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Greek antiquities to masterpieces by artists such as da Vinci (including his incomparable Mona Lisa), Michelangelo and Rembrandt \u2013 it would take nine months to glance at every piece, rendering advance planning essential.",
        "The Sully Wing creates the four sides of the Cour Carr\u00e9e (literally \u2018Square Courtyard\u2019) at the eastern end of the complex; the Denon Wing stretches 800m along the Seine to the south; and the northern Richelieu Wing skirts rue de Rivoli. Long before its modern incarnation, the vast Palais du Louvre originally served as a fortress constructed by Philippe-Auguste in the 12th century (medieval remnants are still visible on the lower ground floor, Sully); it was rebuilt in the mid-16th century as a royal residence in the Renaissance style. The Revolutionary Convention turned it into a national museum in 1793.",
        "The paintings, sculptures and artefacts on display in the Louvre have been amassed by subsequent French governments. Among them are works of art and artisanship from all over Europe and priceless collections of antiquities. The Louvre\u2019s raison d\u2019\u00eatre is essentially to present Western art (primarily French and Italian, but also Dutch and Spanish) from the Middle Ages to about 1848 (at which point the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay takes over), as well as works from ancient civilisations that formed the West's cultural foundations.",
        "When the museum opened in the late 18th century it contained 2500 paintings and objets d\u2019art; the \u2018Grand Louvre\u2019 project inaugurated by the late president Mitterrand in 1989 doubled the museum\u2019s exhibition space, and both new and renovated galleries have opened in recent years devoted to objets d\u2019art such as the crown jewels of Louis XV (Room 66, 1st floor, Apollo Gallery, Denon). The Islamic art galleries (lower ground floor, Denon) are in the restored Cour Visconti.",
        "The richness and sheer size of the place can be overwhelming. However, there\u2019s an array of innovative, entertaining self-guided thematic trails (1\u00bd to three hours; download trail brochures in advance from the website) ranging from a Louvre masterpieces trail to the art of eating, plus several for kids (hunt lions, galloping horses). Even better are the Louvre\u2019s self-paced multimedia guides (adult/child \u20ac5/3). More-formal, English-language guided tours depart from the Hall Napol\u00e9on, which has free English-language maps.",
        "For many, the star attraction is Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s La Joconde, better known as Mona Lisa (Room 6, 1st floor, Denon). This entire section of the 1st floor of the Denon Wing, in fact, is hung with masterpieces \u2013 rooms 75 and 77 have enormous French paintings from Ingres, Delacroix (Liberty Leading the People) and G\u00e9ricault (The Raft of the Medusa), while rooms 1, 3, 5 and 8 contain transcendent pieces by Raphael, Titian, Botticini and Botticelli. On the ground floor of the Denon Wing, take time for Michelangelo\u2019s The Dying Slave and Canova's Psyche and Cupid (Room 4).",
        "But don't rush by the treasures from antiquity: both Mesopotamia (ground floor, Richelieu) and Egypt (ground and 1st floors, Sully) offer fascinating insights into ancient civilisations, as seen in the Code of Hammurabi (Room 3, ground floor, Richelieu) and the Seated Scribe (Room 22, 1st floor, Sully). Also worth a look are the mosaics and figurines from the Byzantine Empire (lower ground floor, Denon), which merge into the state-of-the-art Islamic collection in the Cour Visconti, and, of course, the armless Greek duo, the Venus de Milo (Room 16, ground floor, Sully) and the Winged Victory of Samothrace (top of Daru staircase, 1st floor, Denon).",
        "Also of note are the gilded-to-the-max Napoleon III Apartments (1st floor, Richelieu), Dutch masters Vermeer (Room 38, 2nd floor, Richelieu) and Rembrandt (Room 31, 2nd floor, Richelieu), and the 18th- and 19th-century French painting collection (2nd floor, Sully), which features iconic works like Ingres\u2019 The Turkish Bath (off Room 60).",
        "The main entrance is through the 21m-high Grande Pyramide, a glass pyramid designed by the Chinese-born American architect IM Pei. If you don't have the Paris Museum Pass (which gives you priority), you can avoid the longest queues (for security) outside the pyramid by entering the Louvre complex via the underground shopping centre Carrousel du Louvre. You'll need to queue up again to buy your ticket once inside; buying tickets and renting a multimedia guide online will save you time.",
        "Tickets are valid for the whole day, so you can come and go as you please. The centrepiece of the Carrousel du Louvre is the glass Pyramide Invers\u00e9e, also by Pei."

        "The gardens are a backdrop to the Palais du Luxembourg, built in the 1620s for Marie de M\u00e9dici, Henri IV\u2019s consort, to assuage her longing for the Pitti Palace in Florence, where she had spent her childhood. Since 1958 the palace has housed the S\u00e9nat, the Upper House of French Parliament, which is occasionally visitable by guided tour. East of the palace is the Italianate, 1630-built Fontaine des M\u00e9dici, an ornate fish pond.",
        "Prestigious temporary art exhibitions, such as \u2018C\u00e9zanne et Paris\u2019, take place in the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg. Around the back of the museum, lemon and orange trees, palms, grenadiers and oleanders shelter from the cold in the palace\u2019s orangery. Nearby the heavily guarded H\u00f4tel du Petit Luxembourg was the modest 16th-century pad where Marie de M\u00e9dici lived while the Palais du Luxembourg was being built.

        "The largest Gothic palace ever built, the Palais des Papes was erected by Pope Clement V, who abandoned Rome in 1309 as a result of violent disorder following his election. It served as the seat of papal power for seven decades, and its immense scale provides ample testament to the medieval might of the Roman Catholic church. Ringed by 3m-thick walls, its cavernous halls, chapels and antechambers are largely bare today, but an audioguide (\u20ac2) provides a useful backstory.",
        "Highlights of the palace include 14th-century chapel frescos by Matteo Giovannetti, and the Chambre du Cerf with medieval hunting scenes. It can be hard to take it all in, so it might be worth joining one of the regular guided tours run by the tourist office.",
        "The palace has been inscribed as a World Heritage site by Unesco since 1995. Look out for special events during the Festival d'Avignon, and special son et lumi\u00e8re (sound and light) shows from mid-August to September."

        "Founded by Pope Julius II in the early 16th century and enlarged by successive pontiffs, the Vatican Museums boast one of the world's greatest art collections. Exhibits, which are displayed along about 7km of halls and corridors, range from Egyptian mummies and Etruscan bronzes to ancient busts, old masters and modern paintings. Highlights include the spectacular collection of classical statuary in the Museo Pio-Clementino, a suite of rooms frescoed by Raphael, and the Michelangelo-painted Sistine Chapel.",
        "Housing the museums are the lavishly decorated halls and galleries of the Palazzo Apostolico Vaticano. This vast 5.5-hectare complex consists of two palaces \u2013 the original Vatican palace (nearer to St Peter\u2019s) and the 15th-century Palazzetto di Belvedere \u2013 joined by two long galleries. On the inside are three courtyards: the Cortile della Pigna, the Cortile della Biblioteca and, to the south, the Cortile del Belvedere. You\u2019ll never cover it all in one day, so it pays to be selective.",
        "On the whole, exhibits are not well labelled, so consider hiring an audio guide (\u20ac7) or buying the Guide to the Vatican Museums and City (\u20ac14).",
        "The museums are well equipped for visitors with disabilities, with suggested itineraries, lifts and specially fitted toilets. Wheelchairs are available free of charge from the Special Permits desk in the entrance hall, and can be reserved by emailing accoglienza.musei@scv.va. Parents with toddlers can take prams into the museums.",
        "Pinacoteca",
        "Often overlooked by visitors, the papal picture gallery contains Raphael\u2019s last work, La Trasfigurazione (Transfiguration; 1517\u2013 20), and paintings by Giotto, Fra Angelico, Filippo Lippi, Perugino, Titian, Guido Reni, Guercino, Pietro da Cortona, Caravaggio and Leonardo da Vinci, whose haunting San Gerolamo (St Jerome; c 1480) was never finished.",
        "Museo Chiaromonti & Braccio Nuovo",
        "The Museo Chiaramonti is effectively the long corridor that runs down the east side of the Belvedere Palace. Its walls are lined with thousands of statues and busts representing everything from immortal gods to playful cherubs and ugly Roman patricians. Near the end of the hall, off to the right, is the Braccio Nuovo (New Wing), which contains a famous statue of the Nile as a reclining god covered by 16 babies.",
        "Museo Pio-Clementino",
        "This stunning museum contains some of the Vatican Museums\u2019 finest classical statuary, including the peerless Apollo Belvedere and the 1st-century Laoco\u00f6n, both in the Cortile Ottagono (Octagonal Courtyard). Before you go into the courtyard take a moment to admire the 1st-century Apoxyomenos, one of the earliest known sculptures to depict a figure with a raised arm.",
        "To the left as you enter the courtyard, the Apollo Belvedere is a 2nd-century Roman copy of a 4th-century-BC Greek bronze. A beautifully proportioned representation of the sun god Apollo, it\u2019s considered one of the great masterpieces of classical sculpture. Nearby, the Laoco\u00f6n depicts a muscular Trojan priest and his two sons in mortal struggle with two sea serpents.",
        "Back inside, the Sala degli Animali is filled with sculpted creatures and some magnificent 4th-century mosaics. Continuing on, you come to the Sala delle Muse, centred on the Torso Belvedere, another of the museum\u2019s must-sees. A fragment of a muscular 1st-century-BC Greek sculpture, this was found in Campo de\u2019 Fiori and used by Michelangelo as a model for his ignudi (male nudes) in the Sistine Chapel.",
        "The next room, the Sala Rotonda, contains a number of colossal statues, including a gilded-bronze Ercole (Hercules) and an exquisite floor mosaic. The enormous basin in the centre of the room was found at Nero\u2019s Domus Aurea and is made out of a single piece of red porphyry stone.",
        "Museo Gregoriano Egizio (Egyptian Museum)",
        "Founded by Gregory XVI in 1839, this museum contains pieces taken from Egypt in Roman times. The collection is small, but there are fascinating exhibits including a fragmented statue of Ramses II on his throne, vividly painted sarcophagi dating from around 1000 BC, and a macabre mummy.",
        "Museo Gregoriano Etrusco",
        "At the top of the 18th-century Simonetti staircase, the Museo Gregoriano Etrusco contains artefacts unearthed in the Etruscan tombs of northern Lazio, as well as a superb collection of vases and Roman antiquities. Of particular interest is the Marte di Todi (Mars of Todi), a black bronze of a warrior dating to the late 5th century BC.",
        "Galleria delle Carte Geografiche (Map Gallery)",
        "The last of three galleries \u2013 the other two are the Galleria dei Candelabri (Gallery of the Candelabra) and the Galleria degli Arazzi (Tapestry Gallery) \u2013 this 120m-long corridor is hung with 40 16th-century topographical maps of Italy.",
        "Stanze di Raffaello (Raphael Rooms)",
        "These four frescoed chambers, currently undergoing partial restoration, were part of Pope Julius II\u2019s private apartments. Raphael himself painted the Stanza della Segnatura (1508\u201311) and the Stanza d\u2019Eliodoro (1512\u201314), while the Stanza dell\u2019Incendio (1514\u201317) and Sala di Costantino (1517\u201324) were decorated by students following his designs.",
        "The first room you come to is the Sala di Costantino, which features a huge fresco depicting Constantine\u2019s defeat of Maxentius at the battle of Milvian Bridge.",
        "The Stanza d\u2019Eliodoro, which was used for private audiences, takes its name from the Cacciata d\u2019Eliodoro (Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple), an allegorical work reflecting Pope Julius II\u2019s policy of forcing foreign powers off Church lands. To its right, the Messa di Bolsena (Mass of Bolsena) shows Julius paying homage to the relic of a 13th-century miracle at the lakeside town of Bolsena. Next is the Incontro di Leone Magno con Attila (Encounter of Leo the Great with Attila) by Raphael and his school, and, on the fourth wall, the Liberazione di San Pietro (Liberation of St Peter), a brilliant work illustrating Raphael\u2019s masterful ability to depict light.",
        "The Stanza della Segnatura, Julius\u2019 study and library, was the first room that Raphael painted, and it\u2019s here that you\u2019ll find his great masterpiece, La Scuola di Atene (The School of Athens), featuring philosophers and scholars gathered around Plato and Aristotle. The seated figure in front of the steps is believed to be Michelangelo, while the figure of Plato is said to be a portrait of Leonardo da Vinci, and Euclide (the bald man bending over) is Bramante. Raphael also included a self-portrait in the lower right corner \u2013 he\u2019s the second figure from the right.",
        "The most famous work in the Stanza dell\u2019Incendio di Borgo is the Incendio di Borgo (Fire in the Borgo), which depicts Pope Leo IV extinguishing a fire by making the sign of the cross. The ceiling was painted by Raphael\u2019s master, Perugino.",
        "Sistine Chapel (Cappella Sistina)",
        "Home to two of the world\u2019s most famous works of art \u2013 Michelangelo\u2019s ceiling frescoes (1508\u201312) and his Giudizio Universale (Last Judgment; 1536\u201341) \u2013 the Sistine Chapel is the one place everyone wants to see, and on a busy day you could find yourself sharing it with up to 2000 people.",
        "Michelangelo's ceiling design, which is best viewed from the chapel\u2019s main entrance in the far east wall, covers the entire 800-sq-m surface. With painted architectural features and a cast of colourful biblical characters, it's centred on nine panels depicting stories from the book of Genesis.",
        "As you look up from the east wall, the first panel is the Drunkenness of Noah, followed by The Flood, and the Sacrifice of Noah. Next, Original Sin and Banishment from the Garden of Eden famously depicts Adam and Eve being sent packing after accepting the forbidden fruit from Satan, represented by a snake with the body of a woman coiled around a tree. The Creation of Eve is then followed by the Creation of Adam. This, one of the most famous images in Western art, shows a bearded God pointing his finger at Adam, thus bringing him to life. Completing the sequence are the Separation of Land from Sea; the Creation of the Sun, Moon and Plants; and the Separation of Light from Darkness, featuring a fearsome God reaching out to touch the sun. Set around the central panels are 20 athletic male nudes, known as ignudi.",
        "Opposite, on the west wall is Michelangelo\u2019s mesmeric Giudizio Universale, showing Christ \u2013 in the centre near the top \u2013 passing sentence over the souls of the dead as they are torn from their graves to face him. The saved get to stay up in heaven (in the upper right), the damned are sent down to face the demons in hell (in the bottom right).",
        "Near the bottom, on the right, you\u2019ll see a man with donkey ears and a snake wrapped around him. This is Biagio de Cesena, the papal master of ceremonies, who was a fierce critic of Michelangelo\u2019s composition. Another famous figure is St Bartholomew, just beneath Christ, holding his own flayed skin. The face in the skin is said to be a self-portrait of Michelangelo, its anguished look reflecting the artist\u2019s tormented faith.",
        "The chapel\u2019s walls also boast superb frescoes. Painted in 1481\u201382 by a crack team of Renaissance artists, including Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Pinturicchio, Perugino and Luca Signorelli, they represent events in the lives of Moses (to the left looking at the Giudizio Universale) and Christ (to the right). Highlights include Botticelli\u2019s Temptations of Christ and Perugino\u2019s Handing over of the Keys.",
        "As well as providing a showcase for priceless art, the Sistine Chapel also serves an important religious function as the place where the conclave meets to elect a new pope."

        "In this city of outstanding churches, none can hold a candle to St Peter's (Basilica di San Pietro), Italy\u2019s largest, richest and most spectacular basilica. Built atop an earlier 4th-century church, it was consecrated in 1626 after 120 years' construction. Its lavish interior contains many spectacular works of art, including three of Italy's most celebrated masterpieces: Michelangelo\u2019s Piet\u00e0, his soaring dome, and Bernini\u2019s 29m-high baldachin over the papal altar.",
        "Expect queues and note that strict dress codes are enforced, so no shorts, miniskirts or bare shoulders.",
        "The original church was commissioned by the emperor Constantine and built around 349 on the site where St Peter is said to have been buried between AD 64 and 67. But like many medieval churches, it eventually fell into disrepair and it wasn\u2019t until the mid-15th century that efforts were made to restore it, first by Pope Nicholas V and then, rather more successfully, by Julius II.",
        "In 1506 construction began on Bramante's design for a new basilica based on a Greek-cross plan, with four equal arms and a huge central dome. But on Bramante\u2019s death in 1514, building ground to a halt as architects, including Raphael and Antonio da Sangallo, tried to modify his original plans. Little progress was made and it wasn\u2019t until Michelangelo took over in 1547 at the age of 72 that the situation changed. Michelangelo simplified Bramante\u2019s plans and drew up designs for what was to become his greatest architectural achievement, the dome. He never lived to see it built, though, and it was left to Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana to finish it in 1590.",
        "With the dome in place, Carlo Maderno inherited the project in 1605. He designed the monumental facade and lengthened the nave towards the piazza.",
        "Between October and late May, free English-language tours of the basilica are run by seminarians from the Pontifical North American College. These generally start at 2.15pm Monday through Friday, leaving from the Centro Servizi Pellegrini e Turisti.",
        "Facade",
        "Built between 1608 and 1612, Carlo Maderno\u2019s immense facade is 48m high and 115m wide. Eight 27m-high columns support the upper attic on which 13 statues stand representing Christ the Redeemer, St John the Baptist and the 11 apostles. The central balcony is known as the Loggia della Benedizione, and it\u2019s from here that the pope delivers his Urbi et Orbi blessing at Christmas and Easter.",
        "Interior",
        "The cavernous 187m-long interior covers more than 15,000 sq m and contains many artistic masterpieces, including Michelangelo's hauntingly beautiful Piet\u00e0 at the head of the right nave. Sculpted when he was only 25, it is the only work the artist ever signed \u2013 his signature is etched into the sash across the Madonna's breast.",
        "Nearby, a red floor disk marks the spot where Charlemagne and later Holy Roman Emperors were crowned by the pope.",
        "Dominating the centre of the basilica is Bernini's famous baldachin. Supported by four spiral columns and made with bronze taken from the Pantheon, it stands over the high altar, which itself sits on the site of St Peter's grave. The pope is the only priest permitted to serve at the altar.",
        "Above, Michelangelo's dome soars to a height of 119m. Based on Brunelleschi's design for the Duomo in Florence, the towering cupola is supported by four stone piers named after the saints whose statues adorn the Bernini-designed niches \u2013 Longinus, Helena, Veronica and Andrew.",

        "Excavations beneath the basilica have uncovered part of the original church and what archaeologists believe is the Tomb of St Peter. In 1942 the bones of an elderly, strongly built man were found in a box hidden behind a wall covered by pilgrims' graffiti. And while the Vatican has never definitively claimed that the bones belong to St Peter, in 1968 Pope Paul VI said that they had been identified in a way that the Vatican considered 'convincing'.",

    "introduction": [
        "If you only have the time (or inclination) for one art gallery in Rome, make it this one. Housing what's often referred to as the \u2018queen of all private art collections\u2019, it boasts paintings by Caravaggio, Raphael, and Titian, as well as some sensational sculptures by Bernini. Highlights abound, but look out for Bernini's Ratto di Proserpina (Rape of Proserpina) and Canova's Venere vincitrice (Venus Victrix).",
        "To limit numbers, visitors are admitted at two-hourly intervals, so you'll need to pre-book your ticket and get an entry time.",
        "The museum's collection was formed by Cardinal Scipione Borghese (1579\u20131633), the most knowledgeable and ruthless art collector of his day. It was originally housed in the cardinal's residence near St Peter's but in the 1620s he had it transferred to his new villa just outside Porta Pinciana. And it's here, in the villa's central building, the Casino Borghese, that you'll see it today.",
        "Over the centuries, the villa has undergone several overhauls, most notably in the late 1700s when Prince Marcantonio Borghese added much of the lavish neoclassical decor.",
        "The museum is divided into two parts: the ground-floor gallery, with its superb sculptures, intricate Roman floor mosaics and over-the-top frescoes, and the upstairs picture gallery.",
        "From the basement entrance, stairs lead up to Sala IV, home of Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Ratto di Proserpina (1621\u201322). This flamboyant sculpture, one of a series depicting pagan myths, brilliantly reveals the artist's virtuosity \u2013 just look at Pluto's hand pressing into the seemingly soft flesh of Persephone's thigh. Further on, in Sala III, he captures the exact moment Daphne's hands start morphing into leaves in Apollo e Dafne (1622\u201325).",
        "Another statuesque scene-stealer is Antonio Canova's daring depiction of Napoleon's sister, Paolina Bonaparte Borghese, reclining topless as Venere vincitrice (1805\u201308) in Sala I.",
        "Caravaggio dominates Sala VIII. There's a dissipated-looking Bacchino malato (Young Sick Bacchus; 1592\u201395), the strangely beautiful La Madonna dei Palafenieri (Madonna with Serpent; 1605\u201306), and San Giovanni Battista (St John the Baptist; 1609\u201310), probably Caravaggio's last work. There's also the much-loved Ragazzo col Canestro di Frutta (Boy with a Basket of Fruit; 1593\u201395), and the dramatic Davide con la Testa di Golia (David with the Head of Goliath; 1609\u201310) \u2013 Goliath's severed head is said to be a self-portrait.",
        "Beyond Sala VIII, a portico flanks the grand entrance hall, decorated with 4th-century floor mosaics of fighting gladiators and a 2nd-century Satiro Combattente (Fighting Satyr). High on the wall is a gravity-defying bas-relief of a horse and rider falling into the void (Marco Curzio a Cavallo) by Pietro Bernini (Gian Lorenzo's father).",
        "Upstairs, the pinacoteca offers a wonderful snapshot of Renaissance art. Don't miss Raphael's extraordinary La Deposizione di Cristo (The Deposition; 1507) in Sala IX, and his Dama con Liocorno (Lady with a Unicorn; 1506). In the same room is Fra Bartolomeo's superb Adorazione del Bambino (Adoration of the Christ Child; 1495) and Perugino's Madonna con Bambino (Madonna and Child; first quarter of the 16th century).",
        "Other highlights include Correggio's erotic Danae (1530\u201331) in Sala X, Bernini's self-portraits in Sala XIV, and Titian's great masterpiece, Amor Sacro e Amor Profano (Sacred and Profane Love; 1514) in Sala XX."

Their collection of classical sculpture is one of Italy's finest, including crowd-pleasers such as the iconic Lupa capitolina (Capitoline Wolf), a sculpture of Romulus and Remus under a wolf, and the Galata morente (Dying Gaul), a moving depiction of a dying Gaul warrior. There's also a formidable picture gallery with masterpieces by the likes of Titian, Tintoretto, Rubens and Caravaggio.",
        "Ticket prices increase when there's a temporary exhibition on.",
        "The museums' entrance is in Palazzo dei Conservatori, where you'll find the original core of the sculptural collection on the 1st floor and the Pinacoteca (picture gallery) on the 2nd floor.",
        "Before you head upstairs, take a moment to admire the ancient masonry littered around the ground-floor courtyard, most notably a mammoth head, hand and foot. These all come from a 12m-high statue of Constantine that originally stood in the Basilica di Massenzio in the Roman Forum.",
        "Of the sculpture on the 1st floor, the Etruscan Lupa Capitolina is the most famous. Donated to the Roman people by Pope Sixtus IV, the 5th-century-BC bronze wolf stands over her suckling wards, who were added in 1471. Other highlights include the Spinario, a delicate 1st-century-BC bronze of a boy removing a thorn from his foot, and Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Medusa. Also on this floor, in the modern Esedra di Marco Aurelio, is the original of the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius that stands outside in Piazza del Campidoglio.",
        "Upstairs, the museums' picture collection, mainly Italian works from the 16th and 17th century works, is on show in the Pinacoteca. Each room harbours masterpieces, but two stand out: the Sala Pietro da Cortona, which features Pietro da Cortona's famous depiction of the Ratto delle sabine (Rape of the Sabine Women), and the Sala Santa Petronella, named after Guercino's huge canvas Seppellimento di Santa Petronilla (The Burial of St Petronilla). This airy hall also boasts two important works by Caravaggio: La buona ventura (The Fortune Teller; 1595), which shows a gypsy pretending to read a young man's hand but actually stealing his ring; and San Giovanni Battista (St John the Baptist; 1602), an unusual nude depiction of the youthful New Testament saint with a ram.",
        "A tunnel links Palazzo dei Conservatori to Palazzo Nuovo on the other side of the square via the Tabularium, ancient Rome's central archive, beneath Palazzo Senatorio.",
        "Palazzo Nuovo contains some real showstoppers. Chief among them is the Galata morente, a Roman copy of a 3rd-century-BC Greek original that touchingly depicts the anguish of a dying Gaul warrior. Another superb figurative piece is the Venere Capitolina (Capitoline Venus), a sensual yet demure portrayal of the nude goddess."

        "For a thousand years this monumental cathedral was the most important church in Christendom. Commissioned by Constantine and consecrated in AD 324, it was the first Christian basilica built in the city and, until the late 14th century, was the pope\u2019s main place of worship. It's still Rome\u2019s official cathedral and the pope\u2019s seat as the bishop of Rome.",
        "The basilica has been revamped several times, most notably by Borromini in the 17th century, and by Alessandro Galilei, who added the immense white facade in 1735.",
        "Surmounted by 15 7m-high statues \u2013 Christ with St John the Baptist, John the Evangelist and the 12 Apostles \u2013 Galilei\u2019s facade is an imposing example of late-baroque classicism. The central bronze doors were moved here from the Curia in the Roman Forum, while, on the far right, the Holy Door is only opened in Jubilee years.",
        "The cavernous interior owes much of its present look to Francesco Borromini, who redecorated it for the 1650 Jubilee. It\u2019s a breathtaking sight with a golden gilt ceiling, a 15th-century mosaic floor, and a wide central nave lined with muscular 4.6m-high sculptures of the apostles.",
        "At the head of the nave, the Gothic baldachin over the papal altar is said to contain the relics of the heads of Sts Peter and Paul. In front, a double staircase leads down to the confessio and the Renaissance tomb of Pope Martin V.",
        "Behind the altar, the massive apse is decorated with sparkling mosaics. Parts of these date to the 4th century, but most were added in the 1800s.",
        "At the other end of the basilica, on the first pillar in the right-hand aisle, is an incomplete Giotto fresco. While admiring this, cock your ear towards the next column, where a monument to Pope Sylvester II (r 999\u20131003) is said to sweat and creak when the death of a pope is imminent.",
        "To the left of the altar, the beautiful 13th-century cloister is a lovely, peaceful place with graceful twisted columns set around a central garden."

The 1300-hectare park, 3km south of Agrigento, is split into eastern and western zones. Ticket offices with car parks are at the park's southwestern corner (the main Porta V entrance) and at the northeastern corner near the Temple of Hera (Eastern Entrance).",
        "Eastern Zone",
        "If you only have time to explore part of the site, make it the eastern zone, where you'll find the three best-preserved temples. The 5th-century-BC Tempio di Hera, is perched on the edge of a ridge. Though partly destroyed by an earthquake in the Middle Ages, much of the colonnade remains intact, as does a long altar, originally used for sacrifices.",
        "From here, the path continues westwards, past a gnarled 800-year-old olive tree and a series of Byzantine tombs built into the city walls, to the Tempio della Concordia. This remarkable edifice, the model for Unesco's logo, has survived almost entirely intact since it was constructed in 430 BC. In 1748 the temple was restored to its original form and given the name it's now known by.",
        "The last of the zone's temples, the Tempio di Ercole, is the oldest, dating from the end of 6 BC. Eight of its 38 columns have been raised and you can wander around the remains of the rest.",
        "Down from the main temples, you can see a little temple set on a high base. This is known as the Tomba di Terone, although it dates to 75 BC, about 500 years after the death of Theron, Agrigento's Greek tyrant.",
        "Western Zone",
        "The main feature of the western zone is the crumbled ruin of the Tempio di Giove. Covering an area of 112m by 56m with columns 20m high, this would have been the largest Doric temple ever built had its construction not been interrupted by the Carthaginians sacking Akragas. The incomplete temple was later destroyed by an earthquake.",
        "A short hop away, four columns mark the Tempio dei Dioscuri, a 5th century BC temple that was destroyed by an earthquake and partially rebuilt in the 19th century. Just behind is a complex of altars and small buildings believed to be part of the 6th century BC Santuario delle Divine Chtoniche.",

        "Note that queues are likely, and that you'll be refused entry if you're wearing shorts, a short skirt or a low-cut top.",
        "The chapel's well-lit interior is simply breathtaking. Every inch is inlaid with precious stones, giving the space a lustrous quality. These exquisite mosaics were mainly the work of Byzantine Greek artisans brought to Palermo by Roger II in 1140 especially for this project. They capture expressions, detail and movement with extraordinary grace and delicacy, and sometimes with enormous power \u2013 most notably in the depiction of Christ the Pantocrator and Angels on the dome. The bulk of the mosaics recount the tales of the Old Testament, though other scenes recall Palermo's pivotal role in the Crusades. Some of the mosaics are later and less-assured additions, for instance the Virgin and Saints in the main apse under Christ the Pantocrator. Fortunately, these don't detract too much from the overall achievement.",
        "It's not only the mosaics you should be gazing at \u2013 don't miss the painted wooden ceiling featuring muqarnas, a decorative device resembling stalactites that is unique in a Christian church (and, many speculate, a sign of Roger II's secret identity as a Muslim). The walls are decorated with handsome marble inlay that displays a clear Islamic aesthetic, and the carved marble in the floor is stunning: marble was as precious as any gemstone in the 12th century, so the floor's value at the time of its construction is almost immeasurable by today's standards.",
        "There's a lot to take in, so once inside don't let the attendants hurry you through. Note also that the chapel is sometimes used for weddings, in which case it closes at 4.15pm."

Certainly, the size of the complex \u2013 four interconnected groups of buildings spread over the hillside \u2013 and the 3535 sq m of astoundingly well-preserved multicoloured floor mosaics suggest a palace of imperial standing.",
        "Following a landslide in the 12th century, the villa lay under 10m of mud for some 700 years, and was thus protected from the damaging effects of air, wind and rain. It was only when serious excavation work began in the 1950s that the mosaics, considered remarkable for their natural, narrative style, the range of their subject matter and the variety of their colour, were brought back to light.",
        "The villa's recent restoration has covered almost the entire complex with a wooden roof (to protect the mosaics from the elements), while an elevated walkway allows visitors to view the tiled floors and the structure itself in its entirety. Architects report a dissatisfaction with the structure for the lack of light, and the shadows that obscure the colours and vivacity of the mosaics, but the condition of the mosaics has been much improved.",

In 1748 the temple was restored to its original form and given the name it is now known by.",
        "Another reason why it has survived while other temples have not, is that beneath the hard rock on which the temple stands is a layer of soft clay that acts as a kind of natural shock absorber, protecting it from earthquake tremors.

        "The last remaining wonder of the ancient world; for nearly 4000 years, the extraordinary shape, impeccable geometry and sheer bulk of the Giza Pyramids have invited the obvious questions: \u2018How were we built, and why?\u2019 Centuries of research have given us parts of the answer.",
        "Built as massive tombs on the orders of the pharaohs, they were constructed by teams of workers tens-of-thousands strong.",
        "Today they stand as an awe-inspiring tribute to the might, organisation and achievements of ancient Egypt.",
        "Ongoing excavations on the Giza Plateau, along with the discovery of a pyramid-builders' settlement, complete with areas for large-scale food production and medical facilities, have provided more evidence that the workers were not the slaves of Hollywood tradition, but an organised workforce of Egyptian farmers. During the flood season, when the Nile covered their fields, the same farmers could have been redeployed by the highly structured bureaucracy to work on the pharaoh\u2019s tomb. In this way, the Pyramids can almost be seen as an ancient job-creation scheme. And the flood waters made it easier to transport building stone to the site.",
        "But despite the evidence, some still won\u2019t accept that the ancient Egyptians were capable of such achievements. So-called pyramidologists point to the carving and placement of the stones, precise to the millimetre, and argue the numerological significance of the structures\u2019 dimensions as evidence that the Pyramids were constructed by angels or aliens. It\u2019s easy to laugh at these out-there ideas, but when you see the monuments up close, especially inside, you\u2019ll better understand why so many people believe such awesome structures must have unearthly origins."

The interior is one of the most pleasant places to sit and relax, but the true glory is the exterior of the dome, carved with the finest, most intricate floral designs anywhere in the Islamic world. ",
        "  Qaitbey ruled for 28 years and was the last Mamluk leader with any real power in Egypt. He was a prolific builder, and with some 80 buildings in his name, he truly refined the Mamluk style. Behind the boldly striped facade, the interior has four iwans around a central court lit by large, lattice-screened windows. The interior is panelled in cool marble with a mesmerising decorative wood ceiling.  The adjacent tomb chamber contains the cenotaphs of Qaitbey and his two sisters. The elegant and slender stone minaret, carved with a star pattern, and an intricate floral arabesque, is one of the city's most beautiful.  Climb up for the best view. "

Don't skip the 14th-century cloister gardens, with gurning gargoyle statues that seem to pose around the courtyard. Temporary exhibitions are \u20ac4 extra."
