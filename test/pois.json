        "One of the world\u2019s most renowned green spaces, Central Park spreads across 843 acres of rolling meadows, boulder-studded outcroppings, elm-lined walkways, manicured European-style gardens, a lake and a reservoir \u2014 not to mention an outdoor theater, a memorial to John Lennon, an idyllic waterside eatery (the Loeb Boathouse) and one very famous statue of Alice in Wonderland. Highlights include Sheep Meadow, where thousands of people lounge and play on warm days; Central Park Zoo; and the forest-like paths of the Ramble.",
        "Like the city\u2019s subway system, the vast and majestic Central Park, a rectangle of open space in the middle of Manhattan, is a great class leveler \u2013 exactly what it was envisioned to be. Created in the 1860s and \u201970s by Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux on the marshy northern fringe of the city, the immense park was designed as a leisure space for all New Yorkers, regardless of color, class or creed. It\u2019s also an oasis from the insanity: the lush lawns, cool forests, flowering gardens, glassy bodies of water and meandering, wooded paths providing the dose of serene nature that New Yorkers crave.",
        "Olmsted and Vaux (who also created Prospect Park in Brooklyn) were determined to keep foot and road traffic separate and cleverly designed the cross-town transverses under elevated roads to do so. That such a large expanse of prime real estate has survived intact for so long again proves that nothing eclipses the heart, soul and pride that forms the foundation of New York City\u2019s greatness.",
        "Today, this \u2018people\u2019s park\u2019 is still one of the city\u2019s most popular attractions, beckoning throngs of New Yorkers with free outdoor concerts on the Great Lawn, precious animals at the Central Park Wildlife Center and top-notch drama at the annual Shakespeare in the Park productions, held each summer at the open-air Delacorte Theater. Other recommended stops include the ornate Bethesda Fountain, which edges the Lake and its Loeb Boathouse, where you can rent rowboats or enjoy lunch at an outdoor cafe; the Shakespeare Garden, on the west side between 79th and 80th Sts, with its lush plantings and excellent skyline views; and the Ramble, a wooded thicket that\u2019s popular with bird-watchers. While parts of the park swarm with joggers, in-line skaters, musicians and tourists on warm weekends, it\u2019s quieter on weekday afternoons, especially in less well-trodden spots above 72nd St, such as the Harlem Meer and the North Meadow (north of 97th St).",
        "Folks flock to the park even in winter, when snowstorms inspire cross-country skiing and sledding or just a simple stroll through the white wonderland, and crowds turn out every New Year\u2019s Eve for a midnight run. The Central Park Conservancy offers ever-changing guided tours of the park, including ones that focus on public art, wildlife and places of interest to kids."

        "This sprawling encyclopedic museum, founded in 1870, houses one of the largest art collections in the world. Its permanent collection has more than two million individual objects, from Egyptian temples to American paintings. Known colloquially as \u2018The Met,\u2019 the museum attracts over six million visitors a year to its 17 acres of galleries \u2013 making it the largest single-site attraction in New York City. In other words, plan on spending some time here \u2013 it is B-I-G.",
        "The museum has an unrivaled collection of ancient Egyptian art, some of which dates back to the Paleolithic era. Located to the north of the Great Hall, the 39 Egyptian galleries open dramatically with one of the Met\u2019s prized pieces: the Mastaba Tomb of Perneb (c 2300 BC), an Old Kingdom burial chamber crafted from limestone. Also not to be missed is the Temple of Dendur, built around 10 BC south of Aswan, Egypt, and relocated to the Met in 1978.",
        "On the museum\u2019s 2nd floor, the European Paintings galleries display a stunning collection of masterworks. The \u2018New Galleries for the Art of the Arab Lands, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, and Later South Asia\u2019 are comprised of 15 incredible rooms that showcase the museum\u2019s extensive collection of art from the Middle East and Central and South Asia.",
        "In the northwest corner, the American galleries showcase a wide variety of decorative and fine art from throughout US history. The 27 galleries devoted to classical antiquity are another Met doozy, some of which are dramatically illuminated by natural daylight.",
        "The most popular galleries with children are generally the Egyptian, African and Oceania galleries (great masks) and the collection of medieval arms and armor \u2013 all of which are on the 1st floor. The Met hosts plenty of kid-centric happenings (check the website) and distributes a special museum brochure and map made specifically for the tykes.",
        "One of the best spots in the entire museum is the roof garden, which features rotating sculpture installations by contemporary and 20th century artists. (Jeff Koons, Andy Goldsworthy and Imran Qureshi have all shown here.) But its best feature are the views it offers of the city and Central Park. It\u2019s also home to the Roof Garden Caf\u00e9 & Martini Bar, the best place in the museum for a sip \u2014 especially at sunset. The roof garden is open from April to October.",
        "A desk inside the Great Hall has audio tours in several languages ($7), though you can access audio tours for free if you have a smartphone. Docents also offer guided tours of specific galleries (free with admission). Check the website or information desk for details. If you can\u2019t stand crowds, avoid weekends."
