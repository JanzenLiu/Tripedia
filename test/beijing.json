            "I am endlessly intrigued by B\u011bij\u012bng's ability to reinvent itself. Spending time here is to be on a permanent journey of discovery, where eye-popping buildings appear seemingly overnight, historic h\u00fat\u00f2ng are transformed into hip hang-outs, and new venues open all the time. But some things never change in B\u011bij\u012bng and that is equally enticing. The food is always outstanding and the parks and temples remain oases of peace. Above all, I love being surrounded by the tangible evidence of China's amazing, dramatic history, whether it's the Forbidden City or the Great Wall. It's never boring here.",
            "Food is an obsession for the Chinese and the dazzling array of different dishes you\u2019ll encounter in B\u011bij\u012bng reflects the sheer joy locals take in eating. Dining out is the main social activity; it\u2019s in restaurants that B\u011bij\u012bngers hang out with friends, romance each other, hold family reunions and do business, and the sheer variety of restaurants here is mind-boggling. Menus will have you salivating over succulent Peking duck, delicious dumplings and awesome noodles, but there\u2019s food from every corner of China (and beyond) to be sampled too. From fiery S\u00ecchu\u0101nese to Turkic\u2013inspired Uighur cuisine, B\u011bij\u012bng's 60,000-plus restaurants cover every base.",
            "B\u011bij\u012bng isn\u2019t just the political centre of China \u2013 it\u2019s the cultural heart of the country too. The nation\u2019s top artists, writers, movie-makers and musicians converge here, making this the place to take the pulse of China\u2019s ever-evolving cultural scene. With top-class museums, galleries galore, and an increasing number of music venues, there\u2019s enough to keep you busy day and night. B\u011bij\u012bng is also the centre for the traditional Chinese performing arts. Whether it\u2019s the mystique of Peking opera, tumbling acrobats or the graceful lines of Chinese classical dance that entrances you, the capital has it and more.",
            "Few places on Earth can match the extraordinary historical panorama on display in B\u011bij\u012bng. There are six Unesco World Heritage Sites in this city alone (just one less than the whole of Egypt). At its heart is the magnificent Forbidden City, a royal palace on a scale like no other. B\u011bij\u012bng is also home to sublime temples that aspire to cosmological perfection, while the city centre is criss-crossed by enchanting h\u00fat\u00f2ng: ancient alleyways that teem with life today, as they did hundreds of years ago. And, to cap it all, the awe-inspiring Great Wall snakes its way across the hills north of town.",
            "It's not just the ancient architecture that wows tourists. B\u011bij\u012bng is also home to some of the world's most innovative modern buildings. The world's leading architects clamber for the chance to make their mark on this global powerhouse, and jaw-dropping structures such as the CCTV Building, Galaxy Soho, the NCPA concert hall and the Olympic Stadium are clear signs that B\u011bij\u012bng is not shy about proclaiming its status as China\u2019s capital. Like the temples and palaces of the ancient past, and the imposing socialist realist monuments of the 1950s, these latest additions are built on a scale that screams, \u2018Look at me!\u2019."
