            "The Met, MoMA and the Guggenheim are just the beginning of a dizzying list of art-world icons. You\u2019ll find museums devoted to everything from fin de si\u00e8cle Vienna to immigrant life in the Lower East Side, and sprawling galleries filled with Japanese sculpture, postmodern American painting, Himalayan textiles and New York City lore. For a glimpse of current and future greats, delve into the cutting-edge galleries of Chelsea and the Lower East Side, with their myriad exhibition spaces and festive opening-night parties (usually Thursday night if you want to join in).",
            "When the sun sinks slowly beyond the Hudson and luminous skyscrapers light up the night, New York transforms into one grand stage. Well-known actors take to the legendary theaters of Broadway as world-class soloists, dancers and musicians perform at venues large and small across town. Whether high culture or low, New York embraces it all: in-your-face rock shows at Williamsburg dives, lavish opera productions at the Lincoln Center, and everything in between. This is a city of experimental theater, improv comedy, indie cinema, ballet, poetry readings, burlesque, world music, jazz and so much more. If you can dream it up, it\u2019s probably happening in NYC.",
            "There\u2019s never been a better time to dine in New York. The city has become a hotbed of seasonal and locally sourced cuisine \u2013 with restaurants growing vegetables on roof gardens or their own upstate farms, sourcing meats and seafood from sustainable outfits nearby, and embracing artisanal everything \u2013 from coffee roasting and whiskey distilling to chocolate- and cheese-making. Bars have also taken creativity to new heights, with pre-Prohibition-era cocktails served alongside delectable small plates \u2013 indeed gastropubs are some of the most creative places to get a meal these days. Of course you can also hit the gourmet food-truck scene or dine more traditionally at one of NYC\u2019s 20,000-plus sit-down restaurants.",

            "While there are many reasons to fall for New York, I\u2019ve always loved the energy here. There\u2019s so much creativity in the air, with wildly imaginative works filling the city\u2019s galleries and concert halls \u2013 not to mention its restaurants, with ever more inventive mash-ups of global cuisines. Despite living for many years in New York, I never tire of exploring the metropolis. You can cross continents with the mere swipe of a MetroCard, visiting colorful neighborhoods that contain an astonishing variety of cultures and ethnicities (particularly in Queens). The people, the food, the art: NYC has many virtues, which is why so many of us can\u2019t imagine living anywhere else.",
            "With its compact size and streets packed with eye-candy of all sorts \u2013 architectural treasures, Old World caf\u00e9s, atmospheric booksellers and curio shops \u2013 NYC is an urban wanderer\u2019s delight. Crossing continents is as easy as walking over a few avenues in this jumbled city of 200-plus nationalities. You can lose yourself in the crowds of Chinatown amid brightly painted Buddhist temples, steaming noodle shops and fragrant fishmongers, then stroll up to Nolita for enticing boutiques and coffee-tasting among the craft-minded scenesters. Every neighborhood offers a dramatically different version of New York City \u2013 from the 100-year-old Jewish delis of the Upper West Side to the meandering cobblestone lanes of Greenwich Village. And the best way to experience this city is to walk its streets."

            "On my way from Hong Kong to New York, I stopped in San Francisco for a day. I walked from the Geary St art galleries up Grant Ave to Waverly Place, just as temple services were starting. The fog was scented with incense and roast duck. In the basement of City Lights bookstore, near the Muckraking section, I noticed a sign painted by a 1920s cult: 'I am the door.' It's true. San Francisco is the threshold between East and West, body and soul, fact and fiction. That was 20 years ago. I'm still here. You have been warned.",
            "Consider permission permanently granted to be outlandish: other towns may surprise you, but in San Francisco you will surprise yourself. Good times and social revolutions tend to start here, from manic gold rushes to blissful hippie be-ins. If there's a skateboard move yet to be busted, a technology still unimagined, a poem left unspoken or a green scheme untested, chances are it's about to happen here. Yes, right now. This town has lost almost everything in earthquakes and dot-com gambles, but never its nerve.",
            "Every available Bay Area\u2013invented technology is needed to make dinner decisions in this city, with the most restaurants and farmers markets per capita in North America, supplied by pioneering local organic farms. San Francisco set the gold standard for Wild West saloons, but drinking was driven underground in the 1930s with Prohibition. Today San Francisco celebrates its speakeasies and vintage saloons \u2013 and with Wine Country and local distillers providing a steady supply of America's finest hooch, the West remains wild.",
            "Microclimates add magic realism to San Francisco days: when it's drizzling in the outer reaches of Golden Gate Park, it may be sunny in the Mission. A few degrees' difference between neighborhoods grants permission for salted caramel ice cream in Dolores Park, or a hasty retreat to tropical heat inside California Academy of Sciences' rainforest dome. This town will give you goose bumps one minute, and warm you to the core the next.",
            "If California is one grand, sweeping gesture, a long arm cradling the Pacific, then San Francisco, that seven-by-seven-mile peninsula, is a forefinger pointing upwards. Take this as a hint to look up: you'll notice San Francisco's crooked Victorian rooflines, wind-sculpted treetops and fog tumbling over the Golden Gate Bridge.",
            "Heads are perpetually in the clouds atop San Francisco's 43 hills. Cable cars provide easy access to Russian and Nob Hills, and splendid panoramas reward the slog up to Coit Tower \u2013 but the most exhilarating highs are earned on Telegraph Hill's garden-lined stairway walks and windswept hikes around Land's End."

Watching a game is a local rite of passage, whether you slather on the blue-and-orange body paint for a Bears football game, join the raucous baseball crowd in Wrigley Field's bleachers, or plop down on a bar stool at the neighborhood tavern for whatever match is on TV. Count on making lots of spirited new friends. Should the excitement rub off and inspire you to get active yourself, the city's 26 beaches and 580 parks offer a huge array of play options.",
            "Chicago knows how to rock a festival. Between March and September it throws around 200 shindigs. The specialty is music. Blues Fest brings half a million people to Grant Park to hear guitar notes slide and bass lines roll, all for free. During the three-day Lollapalooza mega-party, rock bands thrash while the audience dances in an arm-flailing frenzy. Smaller, barbecue-scented street fests take place in the neighborhoods each weekend \u2013 though some rival downtown for star power on their stages (oh, hey, Olivia Newton-John at Northalsted Market Days).",

High-flying architecture is everywhere, from the stratospheric, glass-floored Willis Tower to Frank Gehry's swooping silver Pritzker Pavilion to Frank Lloyd Wright's stained-glass Robie House. Whimsical public art studs the streets; you might be walking along and wham, there's an abstract Picasso statue that's not only cool to look at, you're allowed to go right up and climb on it. For art museums, take your pick: impressionist masterpieces at the massive Art Institute, psychedelic paintings at the mid-sized Museum of Mexican Art or outsider drawings at the small Intuit gallery.",

For proof, dip into the third-wave coffee shops, the microbreweries with their casual tasting rooms, or the cozy informal bookstores that remain rock solid in a city that spawned Amazon. Then there are the latest national trends that Seattle has helped create: craft cider, pot shops, micro-distilleries, specialist pie-makers, homemade ice cream and fledgling nano-breweries. Walk the streets and scour the neighborhoods; there\u2019s far more to this city than Starbucks' vanilla lattes and Boeing airplanes.",

It was founded in 1907 to fortify local inhabitants with fresh Northwest produce, and its long-held mantra of \u2018meet the producer\u2019 still echoes enthusiastically around a city where every restaurateur worth their salt knows the name of their fishmonger and the biography of the cow that made yesterday\u2019s burgers.

There\u2019s the aloof, elegant one (Queen Anne), the cool, edgy one (Capitol Hill), the weird, bearded one (Fremont), the independently minded Scandinavian one (Ballard), the grizzled old grandfather (Pioneer Square) and the precocious adolescent still carving out its identity (South Lake Union). You\u2019ll never fully understand Seattle until you\u2019ve visited them all.",

            "Hong Kong's enchanting neighbourhoods and islands offer a sensory feast. You may find yourself swaying along on a historic double-decker tram, cheering with the hordes at the city-centre horse races, or simply gazing out at the glorious harbour. Over 70% of Hong Kong is mountains and sprawling country parks, some also home to geological and historical gems. Escape the city limits on one of the world\u2019s smoothest transport systems and spend your day wandering in a Song-dynasty village, hiking on a deserted island or kayaking among volcanic sea arches.",
            "From off-the-rack Chinese gowns to bespoke speciality knives (and vice versa), the sheer variety of products in Hong Kong\u2019s shops is dizzying. Every budget, need and whim is catered for in 'can do' spirit by a similarly impressive assortment of venues \u2013 glitzy malls where the moneyed shop, chic side-street boutiques and vintage dens where fashionistas find their gems, nerdy gadget bazaars, and a mix of markets where you can haggle to your heart\u2019s content. The city has no sales tax so prices are generally attractive to visitors.",
            "One of the world's top culinary capitals, the city that worships the God of Cookery has many a demon in the kitchen, whether the deliciousness in the pot is Cantonese, Sichuanese, Japanese or French. So deep is the city's love of food and so broad its culinary repertoire that whatever your gastronomic desires, Hong Kong will find a way to sate them. The answer could be a bowl of wonton noodles, freshly steamed dim sum, a warm pineapple bun wedged with butter, a pair of the sweetest prawns, your first-ever stinky tofu, or the creations of the latest celebrity chef.",
            "Underneath the glass and steel of Hong Kong\u2019s commercial persona is a dynamic cultural landscape where its Chinese roots, colonial connections and the contributions of its home-grown talent become intertwined. Here you\u2019re just as likely to find yourself applauding at Asia\u2019s top film festival as joining in dawn taichi or reading the couplets of a local poet to the drumbeat of a dragon boat. Culture could also mean indie music by the harbour or Chinese opera in a bamboo theatre, not to mention the thousands of shows staged year-round at the city's many museums and concert halls.",

Retail therapy is one way of spending new money and the Shanghainese aren't called \u5c0f\u8d44 (xi\u01ceoz\u012b \u2013 'little capitalists') by the rest of China for nothing, especially at the luxury end of things. But it's not all Prada, Gucci and Burberry. There are pop-up boutiques, bustling markets, cool vintage shops and young designer outlets.

            "Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei is home to the world's second-tallest tower and a host of other neck-craning colossi. But it's not all sky-scraping razzmatazz. Beyond the crisply cool veneer of the modern city typified by P\u01d4d\u014dng, you can lift the lid to a treasure chest of architectural styles. The city's period of greatest cosmopolitan excess \u2013 the 1920s and 1930s \u2013 left the city with pristine examples of art deco buildings, most of which survived the 20th-century vicissitudes assailing Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei. And there's more: from Jesuit cathedrals, Jewish synagogues and Buddhist temples to home-grown l\u00f2ngt\u00e1ng (laneway) and sh\u00edk\u00f9m\u00e9n (stone gate) housing, Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei\u2019s architectural heritage is like none other.",

I love that you can slurp a bowl of hand-pulled noodles or bite into soupy xi\u01ceol\u00f3ngb\u0101o dumplings for next to nothing, then splurge on cocktails and fusion fare while gazing out from a rooftop bar on the Bund, over the Hu\u00e1ngp\u01d4 River to P\u01d4d\u014dng\u2019s space-age night scene. Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei's roller-coaster backstory is as decadent as it is debauched, but these days there is a palpable energy and confidence that the city is on the rise\u2026again.",
            "Thirty years ago Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei's dour restaurant scene was all tin trays and scowling waiting staff, with international food confined to the dining rooms of 'exclusive' hotels. Today the mouth-watering restaurant scene is varied, exciting and up to the minute \u2013 and Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei has its own Michelin dining guide in 2017, proving just how far the city has come. Food is the hub of Chinese social life. It\u2019s over a meal that people catch up with friends, celebrate and clinch business deals, and spend hard-earned cash. Some of your best memories of the city could be culinary, so do as the Shanghainese do and make a meal of it.",
            "B\u011bij\u012bng often hogs the limelight as China\u2019s cultural nexus but, for what is essentially a town of wheelers and dealers, Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei is surprisingly creative. Many art galleries are exciting, offering a window onto contemporary Chinese concerns, while nightlife options have exploded. Acrobatics shows are always a favourite and you might grab the chance to catch some Chinese opera. Sh\u00e0ngh\u01cei\u2019s music and club scene is vibrant: from unpretentious jazz and indie venues to all-night hip-hop and electro dance parties, the city swings with the best of them."

Dining out is the main social activity; it\u2019s in restaurants that B\u011bij\u012bngers hang out with friends, romance each other, hold family reunions and do business, and the sheer variety of restaurants here is mind-boggling.

With top-class museums, galleries galore, and an increasing number of music venues, there\u2019s enough to keep you busy day and night. B\u011bij\u012bng is also the centre for the traditional Chinese performing arts.

There are six Unesco World Heritage Sites in this city alone (just one less than the whole of Egypt). At its heart is the magnificent Forbidden City, a royal palace on a scale like no other. B\u011bij\u012bng is also home to sublime temples that aspire to cosmological perfection, while the city centre is criss-crossed by enchanting h\u00fat\u00f2ng: ancient alleyways that teem with life today, as they did hundreds of years ago. And, to cap it all, the awe-inspiring Great Wall snakes its way across the hills north of town.",
            "It's not just the ancient architecture that wows tourists. B\u011bij\u012bng is also home to some of the world's most innovative modern buildings. The world's leading architects clamber for the chance to make their mark on this global powerhouse, and jaw-dropping structures such as the CCTV Building, Galaxy Soho, the NCPA concert hall and the Olympic Stadium are clear signs that B\u011bij\u012bng is not shy about proclaiming its status as China\u2019s capital. Like the temples and palaces of the ancient past, and the imposing socialist realist monuments of the 1950s, these latest additions are built on a scale that screams, \u2018Look at me!\u2019."

            "Yes, Tokyo has more Michelin stars than any other city. Yes, Japanese cuisine has been added to the Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage list. But that's not what makes dining in Tokyo such an amazing experience. What really counts is the city's long-standing artisan culture. You can splash out on the best sushi of your life, made by one of the city's legendary chefs using the freshest, seasonal market ingredients. You can also spend \u00a5800 on a bowl of noodles made with the same care and exacting attention to detail, from a recipe honed through decades of experience.",
            "Tokyo may be forever reaching into the future but you can still see traces of the shogun's capital on the kabuki stage, at a sumo tournament or under the cherry blossoms. It's a modern city built on old patterns, and in the shadows of skyscrapers you can find anachronistic wooden shanty bars and quiet alleys, raucous traditional festivals and lantern-lit yakitori (grilled chicken) stands. In older neighbourhoods you can shop for handicrafts made just as they have been for centuries, or wander down cobblestone lanes where geisha once trod.",
            "From giant robots to saucer-eyed schoolgirls to a certain, ubiquitous kitty, Japanese pop culture is a phenomenon that has reached far around the world. Tokyo is the country's pop-culture laboratory, where new trends grow legs. Come see the latest looks bubbling out of the backstreets of Harajuku, the hottest pop stars projected on the giant video screens in Shibuya, or the newest anime and manga flying off the shelves in Akihabara. Gawk at the giant statues of Godzilla; shop for your favourite character goods; or pick up some style inspiration just walking down the street."

The mother of all shrines, Fushimi Inari-Taisha, has mesmerising arcades of vermilion torii (entrance gate to a Shint\u014d shrine) spread across a mountainside.",
            "Few cities of this size offer such a range of excellent restaurants. Work your way through the entire spectrum of Japanese food, from impossibly refined cuisine known as kaiseki to hearty plebeian fare like ramen. There\u2019s also a wide range of French, Italian and Chinese restaurants, where the famed Japanese attention to detail is paired with local ingredients to yield fantastic results. Best of all, many of Kyoto\u2019s restaurants are in traditional wooden buildings, where you can gaze over intimate private gardens while you eat.",
            "While the rest of Japan has adopted modernity with abandon, the old ways are still clinging on in Kyoto. Visit an old sh\u014dtengai (market street) and admire the ancient speciality shops: tofu sellers, washi (Japanese handmade paper) stores and tea merchants. Then wander through the old streets of Nishijin and Gion past machiya (traditional Japanese townhouses). That's not to say there's nothing modern about Kyoto \u2013 arriving into futuristic Kyoto Station is a stark sign of that. And throughout the city, young Kyotoites don the hottest new fashions, while craft beer and single-origin coffee is taking over.",
            "No educated Kyotoite would dare send a letter without making a reference to the season. The city\u2019s geisha change their hair ornaments 12 times a year to celebrate the natural world. And Kyoto\u2019s confectioners create seasonal sweets that reflect whatever is in bloom. Starting in February and lasting through the summer, a series of blossoms burst open like a string of firecrackers: plums, daphnes, cherries, camellias, azaleas and wisteria, among many others. And don\u2019t forget the shinryoku (the new green of April) and the brilliant autumn foliage of November."

            "Rio's beaches have long seduced visitors. Copacabana Beach became a symbol of Rio during the 1940s, when international starlets would jet in for the weekend. Hogging the spotlight these days is Ipanema Beach, its fame and beauty unabated since bossa nova stars Tom Jobim and Vin\u00edcius de Moraes introduced the world to its allure in the 1960s. For cariocas (residents of Rio), the beach is Rio's backyard \u2013 a playground that's free and open to all, offering endless enjoyment in the form of football, volleyball, surfing, snacking, drinking or simply relaxing amid the passing parade of people.",
            "Looking out from the 710m peak of Corcovado, you will see why Rio is called the Cidade Maravilhosa (Marvelous City). Lushly forested mountains fringe the city, shimmering beaches trace the shoreline and a string of tiny islands lie scattered along the seafront. Far from being mere cinematic backdrop, this seaside beauty hosts outstanding outdoor adventures: hiking in the Tijuca rainforest, cycling alongside the lake and beaches, sailing across Ba\u00eda de Guanabara, and surfing, rock climbing and hang gliding amid one of the world's most stunning urban landscapes.",
            "Music is the lifeblood of Rio, with a soundtrack comprising rock, old-school bossa nova, hip-hop, funk and Brazil's many regional styles. Above all there's samba, a rapid-fire style of music with African influences and an infectious beat that is synonymous with Rio. You can hear it all over town, but the soul of samba resides in Lapa, an edgy red-light district that is home to dozens of live-music halls and an enormous weekend street party that draws revelers from all walks of life. Samba is also the integral sound during Carnaval, and the danceable backing music to street parties and all-night parades.",
            "Speaking of Carnaval, Rio knows how to party. Whether you call it joie de vivre, Lebensfreude or lust for life, cariocas have it in spades. Carnaval, and the buildup to it, is the most obvious manifestation of this celebratory spirit. But Rio has many other occasions for revelry: celebrations after a big Flamengo (or Vasco, Fluminense or Botafogo) soccer match; weekend samba parties around town; baile funk parties in the favelas (slums, informal communities); and boat parties on the bay \u2013 not to mention major fests such as R\u00e9veillon (New Year's Eve) and the Festas Juninas.",
            "By Tom Le Mesurier, Local",
            "The arrival of summer signals the start of Rio\u2019s most intense period of partying and celebration. Christmas and New Year festivities run seamlessly into Carnival. And although the main event doesn\u2019t start until late February, the samba schools\u2019 weekly ensaios (rehearsal events) are in full swing by the start of December. Ever the outdoors city, the rising temperatures draw locals and tourists alike to Rio\u2019s beaches and forest waterfalls, and the longer days give visitors even more time to gaze in awe at the city\u2019s abundance of breath-taking views. On clear, sunny days, the iconic landmarks \u2013 Corcovado, Sugarloaf Mountain and Ipanema beach \u2013 will not disappoint. However, Rio has plenty more to offer those willing to dig a little deeper. The city\u2019s rich culture of music and food is best explored in the bars and samba clubs in the bohemian neighborhoods of Lapa and Santa Teresa. And although you are never far from the manic noise of a party, some of Rio\u2019s most charming pleasures are the simplest: enjoying an ice cold beer on the Mureta da Urca, a tranquil stroll through the Botanical Gardens or taking in the sunset from the rocks of Arpoador."
